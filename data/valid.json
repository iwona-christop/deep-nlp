Flavour is quite bitter for an English IPA, nice hop kick to it while still being quite balanced. Nice carbonation level. I kept meaning to go to The Beer Store to try this and I'm glad I finally did."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12oz bottle obtained in the No BS 4 BIF via dirtylou. Thanks for the opportunity. Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/8\" tan head over the clear burnished copper brew. Head is, as expected for the style, gone in a flash, with lots of legs but not much lacing. Aroma is lightly of leather and strongly of alcohol. Taste follows the nose to start, goes sweet in the middle, and then the alcohol comes on strong. Some fruitiness present, but really all about the booze here. Mouthfeel is a little harsh, and drinkability is kind of limited, this is really a sipper. But thank god it's no Beast."}
{"label": 2, "text": "HUGE thanks to Justin for sending this great surprise my way! A- Body is a very hazy brass color. Pours with a 1 finger or so foamy white head which eventually fades to a thin collar. Some lacing is left behind in the glass. S- Mostly exotic fruit in the nose-mango, peach, a bit of grapefruit and pineapple-nose is really juicy and fruity. Minimal herbal hops as well. T- This is a lot like a Southern Tier IPA upfront-lots of herbal/grassy hops, with a mild exotic fruit background. Finish is packed full of spicy hops and some citrus juice-finish is rather dry if slipped slowly-but extra spicy if sipped repetitively. M- Medium to high tinlgly carbonatoin and a lightweight slightly juicy body. Troegs always does a nice job with mouthfeel. D- This is no hopback or nugget nectar-but this is a prety good IPA overall. The flavors arent extremely bright (this IPA has aged slightly-but it doesnt taste stale at all). The juicy mouthfeel mixed with the spicy character really makes this unique. Good job by Troegs-and I cant wait to try 38 and 39 (may set up a trade for 40)"}
{"label": 1, "text": "A - Pours a clear dark straw color with a smallish white head. S - A bit funky, grassy hops, sweet maltiness. Not a lot of fruit in here. T - Definitely on the sweet side. There's a hint of lemon and a very mild hop bitterness. Alcohol is noticeable and tasty. M - Somewhat astringent, light bodied. D - Not bad. Not terribly exciting I guess, but serviceable and refreshing."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Not a pleasant experience cant believe this brew is still in production. Clear lemon yellow pour, quick vanishing white head. Aroma of veggies and some euro skunk. Musty quaff, maybe some hints of bread an earthy finish that left me wanting a water to help wash out the taste. Was a free gift, drank the whole 500ml, of course."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a hazy dark amber with a small white head and seemingly having medium-high carbonation. The smell is a pleasant spiciness with mild pumpkin. It is medium-bodied and sits well in the mouth. The taste is where it's at! The pumpkin and spices land much harder than I would have expected from the milder scent. It's got a strong finish and aftertaste which is really delicious. This one's not too heavy either so it's really drinkable. I'll definitely be having this one again."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Beautiful label designed by Charlie Finkel. The Pinkus Muller Munster Alt is certainly different than the altbiers common to Dusseldorf. It's yellow-gold in color; with a frothy head of bright-white foam that holds quite well, slowly drops to a creamy cap, and leaves wide rings of sticky lace about the glass with each sip. The nose offers fresh, sweet, and grainy malt. In the mouth its gently effervescent carbonation bristles the tongue before it warms to become somewhat creamy, displaying its medium body. The flavor is much as the nose suggests, with its lightly sweetish and very subtly tart malt dominating. Some hops and a bit of very low key yeasty fruitiness come into play; and it's grassy, slightly doughy, and very mildly bitter with an underlying acidity that also helps to balance it. This is a great, easy drinking, refreshing, and mildly complex beer that would be perfect in a wide variety of situations; and one that would pair easily with an even greater selection of foods. Quite nice!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "330 ml bottle, thanks to oh6gdx and chris_o. ABV is 6.5%. The beer starts pouring out as soon as the cap is removed. Cloudy golden brown colour, huge to moderate head. Yeasty aroma with notes of oranges, apricots and coriander. Rich mouthfeel, high level of carbonation. The flavour is sweet, spicy, yeasty and fruity, with lots of residual sugars. Hints of honey too. Moderate hops in the slightly peppery finish. Maybe a tad too sweet, but still an interesting beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Deep chestnut, amber body poured out of a 22oz bomber. A rocky, mammoth beige head topped off this brew with serious vengance. The aroma is just like sticking your head into a sack of freshly dried whole leaf hops. A piney kick in the hops (maybe Simcoe dry-hopping?). This will be a welcome to any hop head. The taste is nicely hopped right at the start and the carmel malt shows midway through. The bittering hops slap you in the face after the sweetness resides. I love a hop bite, but this may have been a little too much for this beer. It seems a bit unbalanced. Those who fear hops and love typical ambers will be easily turned away from this one. Bear Republic has never been afraid of hops (god bless them!), but this may be a bit harsh for some. Overall, nice brew, but again the intense bite seems a bit out of place."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: Dark slightly cloudy amber/brown with a fizzy head. S: Yeasty malts with just a bit of a sour smell (but not in a bad way). T: Quite good actually. Nice take on a bitter. Definitely some nut flavor, but with a nice bit of hop bite too. A little bit of caramel too. It got better as I drank more. Some spices in there too. Slightly peppery. M: Good. Slightly thin body, but that works ok with this beer and carbonation. D: Quite good. Very drinkable. You know, this isn't a bad beer. Not the most interesting, but it's pretty tasty. Note: At the $5/500ml price, this is not a deal. I picked this up on clearance at World Market for $2.50. It was worth that."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours nearly jet black, 2 fingers of tan/off white head, light lacing at top of the glass. Smell is of dark fruit, raisin, plum leather, dark cherry and belgian yeast. Taste is of dark fruit and raisin with yeast in the finish not much else other than that, lacks depth in profile. Thin mouthfeel and slightly watery carbonation a little too high. Not a bad brew but pretty one dimensional and slightly bland from a brewery of their caliber."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Left over spring seasonal. Purchased a 6 for $4.99. Appearance: Poured into a weizen glass, the beer is a murky dark gold to orange in color. I get a nice 1 to 2 inch white head which settles to a cover on the liquid leaving some lace as I drink the beer. Smell: Citrousy, some lemon and a hint or orange as well. A touch sweet smelling. There are some grainy wheat malt and yeasty scents as well. Taste: The taste follows the smell. Some wheat malt, then the slightly sweet citrous fruits. No bitterness here. I do get the feeling that this is a wheat beer mascarading around like a witbier, much like the \"Hefeweizen\" is just a wheat ale. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body, well carbonated. A lively beer on the tongue with a crisp finish. Drinkability: A spring seasonal that would be welcome in my fridge in the summer. A nice refreshing easy drinker."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I love beer and I love Whiskey. This is a great beer as long as you like alcohol. Very strong, but the alcohol was fairly well hidden. Not a session beer by any stretch, but still very drinkable compared to other beers in the 10%+ range (yes I'm looking at you EKU 28). Not much carbonation and just a bit foggy, mine had no sediment... is the 15% different from the 13 I've seen mentioned? Malty and sweet, but well hopped and not at all cloying as I feared."}
{"label": 2, "text": "The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a lot of floaties and a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent with a musty, dry aroma. It has a bit of lemon zest. The taste is good. It has a smooth, bitter flavor with a malty hop aftertaste. It is a dry, musty brew with good mouthfeel. It is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. This is a fine German Pilsner. It has excellent flavor and mouthfeel; a good drinker."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I thought this to be a rather novel beer; I've had Alaskan Smoked Porter before, and this is definitely smoked to a new extreme. I would recommend it as a beer experience although not as an everyday drinking occasion. It pours an opaque black with a moderate amount of tan head. Aroma is definitely of smoke, or as my wife (who doesn't know anything about beer) described it, \"ham.\" Taste is also a bit like a smoked meat. Very interesting, but I am not sure that you could call this beer \"true-to-style.\" I'd recommend it, but wouldn't call it a great beer. I've had this and O'Fallon's pumpkin ale. They are both definitely extreme, but more in the way of curiousities than in a way that I would rank with elite beers. Nonetheless, I'll keep trying what they put out!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a bright yellow with a thin lacing of head. Smells of bananas and faint spices with a little wheat and yeast notes as well. Taste is much like the nose; banana and clove up front with wheat and yeast in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a good deal of carbonation. I generally find hefeweizens to be unimpressive. This is one I will drink."}
{"label": 2, "text": "22 oz bomber poured in a pint glass A - hazy orange/amber color with a fluffy beige head that just kept rising out over the rim of the glass. The head had plenty of legs but eventually settled down leaving terrific sticky lace. S - piney/citrus/passionfruit hoppy aroma, with a sweet malty background. T - this is a wonderful beer, the use of their own hybrid 'simcoe hop(s)' give this beer a passionfruit/citrus flavor with perfect malt balance. M - a tounge tingler, sort of like sticking a 9 volt battery on the tip of your tongue, fantastic mouthfeel. D - 9%abv is just right for this beer, the alcohol is hidden in the wonderful taste, but will sneak up on you very fast if you're not careful. Final Note: This beer is a great value and great tasting."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Thick, gooey, and black. Tan head is full and thick with good retention. Nose is lacking. Hints of toffee, caramel, sweet malt, milk chocolate, lactose, and a light roasty quality. Just somewhat out there. Sweet toffee and caramel malt. With a sour milk taste in the mid palate. Virtually no finish. Hints of vanilla and milk chocolate. A blueberry, black raspberry lingers as it warms up. Mouthfeel is thin and week overall a beer that is just missing in all the right places."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Sam Adam's Pale Ale pours a couple fingers of loose foam over a clear honey colored brew. Carbonation is slow, and the nose is herbal hop and fruity English yeast esters. The flavor is tart, slightly fruit malt up front with vanilla notes and a firm, slightly medicinal herbal hop finish. A bit too light and a bit too clear, but otherwise a good take on the English Pale Ale style. Mellow and tasty."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Fancy lookin bottle. Let's see whats inside: Pours a tawny brown-red. The nose is yeasty and fruity, spiced-plum aromas. The flavor is complex and delicious. Actually, this beer is very close in flavor profile to a nice port, sans teeth aching sweetness. It is fruity (heavy black currants and slightly, dare I say, pruney?) , and yeasty, with a powerful kick (not untolerable but almost too much for me) of alcohol and flat hop bitterness in the finish. Sure is a fine beer, as most unibroues are, and like a recent previous reviewer said, has that very noticeable uni-yeast, that is discernable in all it's offerings."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This brewery is one of my and my wifes favorites. A- It poured brownish with a nice two finger white head. S- As soon as you pour this beer you smell the pine and spices. Smells a bit malty with a stong cinnamon and pine as you investigate further. With an 8.3% abv you would think you would get more of an alcohol smell. T- Piney but no alcohol bite. M- Slight carbination but no alcohol BUT no doubt pine and spice. D- This beer isn't bad for a christmas beer but the more I drink the more I cant get that pine taste out, yea too much pine."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Slight juniper nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is juniper and hops, finish is hoppy and bitter. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."}
{"label": 0, "text": "What the hell was this? I have never tasted rat poison, but I am pretty sure it tastes just like this stuff. (The only thing that I can think of that could explain this mess is if they used a ton of Amarillo hops - only those hops can give off such a harsh, \"I'm chewing on sawdust\" type of taste to a beer. But the website says magnums and goldings, so I guess I am wrong) Looked nice, with its deep copper body and pretty creamy stubborn head. Smell was fine, but did give me a hint to what was coming with its aggressive, semi-grating hoppage rubbing me the wrong way. Feel was thicker than any other IPA I have ever had, perhaps a bit too heavy. But the taste, oh the taste. The only reason that I cannot give it a 1 is that I finished a pint, so it couldn't have been the most awful thing, but it took me about two hours to get it down. Thick and rough, this was like a IIPA gone wrong. I will give this another chance next time I see it, but only because I cannot believe that SN would put out something that is consistently this awful."}
{"label": 2, "text": "12 oz. bottle via trade decanted into a globe. Bottle cellared around a year. A: Black tinged with the essence of blood. Not much head during the pour, but a nice swirl of fine bubbles remains on the beer and clings for dear life to the edge of the glass. S: Cocoa, fresh raspberries, and a slight breadiness create an exceptionally pleasing nose. T: This hits all the sweetest spots for me. Rich, malty, and chocalatey goodness melds with a pleasing raspberry flavor that enhances rather than takes center stage. Bready roastiness is tangy on the tip of my tongue rather than bitter. Delicious beer, though personally I might like it a tad stronger--but just right for 8%. M: Smooth and rich with nice carbonation for the thickness. I have had thicker imperial stouts, but those have been bigger beers in general. D: One of the best drinking imperial stouts I have had. I sincerely wish I had more than one bottle to drink right now and I definitely want more of this. Strong enough to please an imperial stout drinker, but not too strong to prevent me from having another. What can I say? Two of my favorite types of beer in one. Imperial Stout and raspberries, and it is done right. Definitely recommended for fans of either variety of beer."}

Light-medium body, and fairly drinkable, though not always what I'm in the mood for."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Tasted this beer by half-pint at the Wenlock Arms, London, last week. A: it pours an amber hue with a slightly orangey hint; the head is thin but foamy, against a static body... very low carbonation. S: deep flowery scent (peace-blossom mixed with elderflower?) and sweetish lemony-zesty aroma (Cascade or the like) upfront, against the backdrop of peaches and mildly-sweetish malts. T: refreshingly citrus-fruity and flowery taste of hops leads the palate; the slightly bitter-sweet citrus-zest (like white grapefruit) lies on a bed of mildly sweet malts; more floral and root-vegetable like bitterness with slightly spicy flavour of coriander seeds lend to a nuanced salty texture at the back, finished rather clean and just a bit dryish, with good amount of fruity bitter-sweetness lingering... M&D: medium-bodied and very light and lifting on the palate, this is a fine beer with a citrus-theme and a touch of spice, albeit a bit sweet on balance. Recommended."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Sam Adams Boston (American Pale) Ale is amber in color with a half inch, beige head that rapidly reduces to a collar. Unfortunately the aroma is that typical lager aroma, nothing to be proud of. The taste really doesn't offer much either, other than being very dry. No citrus or pine bitter, just plain bitter. No malt to speak of, nothing to attempt to balance the bitterness. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is only fair, despite the low ABV. Hey, I like some hops bitter, but give it some flavor or balance, too. I find Boston Ale unsatisfying."}

Roasted malts and a citrus/vanilla aftertaste. M: Oily, medium carbonation and a light body. D: Well, not my style at all. I like stouts were the chocolate tones comes naturally. It often takes brewers ages to get that refined taste. This is a quick shot and therefor highly unbalanced. Will not drink this again. For me adding huge amounts of chocoalte is the same as adding chemicals to beer."}

{"label": 1, "text": "I have been wanting to try this one for quite a while, and was not disappointed. Troegenator poured to about 1/2\" head, which dissipated to less than 1/8\" and then lingered. Color is a beautiful, crystal-clear amber -- really terrific. Nose is distincly malty and bready, with little to no hops, and tones of caramel. Mouthfeel is robustly-bodied, but the high carbonation keeps it very crisp on your tongue. As for taste, great malt flavor, and very sweet foretaste, which evens out to caramels and some very nutty tones, and finishes with a rounded hops flavor and a hops bitterness just enough to balance out the sweetness in the aftertaste. Maybe a faint taste of alcohol, but considering ABV, it's well-masked. Great beer from start to finish -- I'm not sure I'd drink more than one at a time or even drink it with food or anything else -- but I will definitely drink this again, and recommend it. All in all, a great-tasting and complex beer you can just sit with and enjoy with no other distractions."}
{"label": 1, "text": "On tap in a shaker pint glass at Winking Lizard on 1/29/11 Very dark in the glass. One finger puffy, tan head. Thin layer of retention and some lace. Smells really nice; simple, not fussy. Good showing of dry, roasted dark malts, Coffee grounds, bitter dark chocolate. Earthy overtones. Tastes comparably dry with maybe a touch less roastiness. Regardless, roasted, bitter coffee notes aren't lacking. Quite a bit of dry bitterness, actually. Not much for cocoa or chocolate (hints of chocolate as it warms). Very faint fruit notion - dark and tangy. Ample carbonation accents a gritty, medium-full feel. Fizzy carbonation but not bad for the style. Dry finish. Aside from the carbonation (in this case personal preference) this drinks just fine. Swirling helps retention and cuts down on the carbonation, too. The 3.1 abv is a plus as well."}
{"label": 2, "text": "My favorite Buzzard's so far. Clean crisp lager, full bright gold with terrific head after a vigorous pour. Subdued flowery odor, smooth malts balanced perfectly by mild hops. A perfect choice for after working on the car in the hot sun for an hour or so. Reminiscent of Czech pilsners, particularly Budvar with the soft cushiony mouthfeel, so soft and exquisite. A faint metallic twinge in the finish gives this beer a little hardness, perhaps in keeping with the Dortmunder style. If you've got a friend who won't drink anything other than Bud/Miller/Coors, one of these will knock him out."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a dark brown and viscious with no head at all. Some bubbles clinging to the edges of the glass but that's about it. Blue bottle! Smells like banana runts, and figs dumped into a snifter of Capt. Morgan's Private Stock. Dark fruits (raisins, plums) and lack of carbonation really give this beer a port-like taste up front. Watery dark malt and brown sugar underneath. Thin mouthfeel."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A - Clear copper. Thick, dense foam. S - Fruity, peppery spice, grapefruity citrus and honey undertones. T - Sweet-ish, not too bitter and a soft alcoholic tone.

A strong malty aroma with hints of toffee and chocolate. Nicely balanced with a slightly burnt flavoring. Very little bitterness yet the sweetness was not cloying. A little too much to make a good session beer but I think its a excellent representation of what a stout should be."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a relatively clear golden amber into my imperial pint glass yielding an inch or so of head, slowly settling to a film on top. Aromas are light and crisp with more of a hoppy nose. Carbonation hits the tongue and follows with a bit of citrus and something sweetish - not sure how to place it. Follows through with a bunch of hops - bitter and chewy - leaving a bit of cotton on the tongue and eventualy residing back in a dry place called bitterland. This is an interesting brew, everything it said it was on the bottle. Not that I would drink this with any regularity but it does have a quaffable quality to it indeed, and at 8% that is trouble. I would, however, much prefer a nice sessionable bitter."}

TASTE As it has weak smell, so does the taste. It actually taste like a light beer. Not that its bad in taste, but there is not much flavor. MOUTHFEEL It's well carbonated and is slightly coarsed. OVERALL It's not bad if you want to pound down beers in quantity, but as for taste, there is nothing special."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A: Poured a deep rustic copper-orange color with a light tan head that faded rather quickly leaving a faint lacing. S: a huge belgian spice aroma of spicy oranges, ripe dark fruit, sweet malt and alcohol. T: The flavor had a deep malty flavor, some cola, raisins and alcohol. There was some ripe fruit as well a slight alcohol burn with some sweet caramel mixed in. The finish finds a big bitterness that was dry while the alcohol gets more noticeable when it warms. M: Medium fullness with a lively carbonation and a slight creaminess. D: A winter sipper by the fireplace on a cold night. Alcohol is quit big at first but gets easier to manage deeper into the drink which makes this much more enjoyable as the night progresses."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The beer honestly looks like it might have a little spice to it; a fiery amber lining kindles under and runs up the sides of the glass while an uncanny Tabasco looking liquid sits between them. It's not exactly pretty and I can't think of anybody who'd be too enticed by the sight of it (the fact that it's nearly completely flat doesn't exactly help either). Despite hearing heedful warnings from fellow beer drinkers that this is aggressively spicy, the aroma doesn't seem to throw up any flags. I was expecting five alarm but this is two, two and a half at best. While a faint must of cracked peppercorns is noted, its bouquet is comprised more so of the generic and familiar toasty grainy scent of rye malt. That being said, if you so desire, swirling acts like a dial that can be used to turn the heat up (and once you let a little air through it the temperature is quickly cranked). Similarly, the peppercorns don't play out much in the flavour - at least not initially. Toasty, caramelly rye malts start things off but the pepper is definitely what's remembered... What the brewery calls \"a pleasant, spicy, tingling sensation on the tongue\" I find an irritating itch in the back of the throat. My tongue feels fine, if anything pleased by the rye flavour, but the back of my throat feels as though someone put cigarette through it. I wouldn't consider it \"spicy\" - seasoned, pungent yes. Peppery, obviously. From what little I've watched of those food network chef competitions, one of the judges' main complaints always seems to be under/over seasoning - I'd be curious to know what they think of this. I think the seasoning is fine but it's definitely under malted. Pepper aside this is fairly tasteless and too light-bodied, both for the seasoning and in general. I'll give Dieu Du Ciel! credit for making something far more agreeable with peppercorns than I thought possible. I don't care for it enough, however, to understand the motivation for year-round production and distribution, especially when the brewpub has better offerings. Whether I liked it enough to buy again we'll have to see, but I'm good for now."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Thanks to overlord for this extra. Poured from a bomber into my smuttynose tulip. The pour is a pale orange/yellow that glows vibrantly when held to the light. There is a soapy white head that fades pretty quickly that leaves little lacing and there is not a lot of carbonation. The smell is lemon zest and citrusy hop, but it's a pretty mild smelling brew. There's a little graham cracker malt that comes through in the smell, but very little. The taste is a very balanced blend of lemon, fresh cut grass and again that very faint graham cracker sweet malt that gives a nice balance. The mouthfeel is very impressive, as the beer is very light and sharply crisp throughout. The lemon, grassy hop and slight maltiness roll together and the beer is very light bodied and perfectly carbonated to match the flavors. This is a beer that I feel I could drink multiple bombers of in a sitting, sadly there is only one."}

Taste: OK, not quite as sweet as the HB, but definite malty profile, with minimal hops. Mouthfeel: Light bodied, carbonated.

And from the good people of City BC, LLC, no less. I wonder, as I drink their products (NOT their beers), how they sleep at night. A special circle in Hell must be reserved for purveyors of such swill, or so I would believe if that were my belief system. I am at the mercy of the almighty CAN and so, I proceed only hoping to come out on the other side. Once I cracked the top, I was committed! The CANQuest will abide nothing less. I saw a finger of bone-white head that looked like something I might see from 7-Up as it popped, fizzled and reduced to wisps in record time. My liver began to hurt. The color was a golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. And now, for the moment of truth - I leaned in, taking a deep whiff. Yoi! It smelled like a plastics manufacturing plant or maybe the production facility for styrofoam. My liver began banging around, hoping for escape in the face of the inevitable. I took a good mouthful, in case I might have to abandon the quest. Whew! I was suddenly sad that I did not have a gas station nearby as I could sell someone the remainder for their tank. I got an initial flavor of VERY green apples which gave way to a flavor resembling only the finest unleaded gasoline. Perfect, if you are looking to commit suicide by beer. The finish was hot in a molten way. I was afraid to do anything that might possibly create a spark. My liver disengaged and began shoving other organs out of its way in its search for an exit. My eyes began to water and I could feel the suction pump vacuuming the moisture out of my brain en route to a stellar hangover. By my second mouthful, I was praying to a God in whose existence I was heretofore an unbeliever. Remember the old saw about atheists and foxholes? Incoming! I began to taste cotton candy, another sign of a quality beer. I refilled my glass, watching it come out of the CAN like viscous apple juice. This is wrong on so many levels, it is not even quantifiable. I began to have convos with my Pops, my grandparents, and my uncle Rick, all long deceased, ala Willy Loman in \"Death of a Salesman\". I see dead people! Why are they all disapproving of my beer? CAN it be that I may be on my way to join them? I am pressing on. By my third swallow, I was drooling openly, unable to control my motor functions and preparing to urinate in the sink. Damn, this is real good! I am coming around to their POV - nothing like a good, cheap erasure of my mind on a Friday night, especially on the cheap. Cheep, cheap. Hoo ha. Who R U? I CANnot open the bay doors right now, Dave. Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do ... I happy to pleased meet you are. Where CAN I get some more of this jaunt? Taa daa. I'm here! Lucky you. Wait, what was I supposed to be doing? Sorry, I've got to go, in order to operate a construction crane high above multiple people. Good times!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours into my glass a dark , dark, DARK red with a solid inch of creamy light tan head on top. Hold it up to the light to get deep, vibrant ruby red colors exploding from the glass. Aromas of deep rich caramel malts. Some toffee sweetness meets a solid citrusy, green herbal hop as well. Bold malt aromas here. First sip brings a bold somewhat sweet caramel toffee maltiness. Flows into a slightly bready flavor that gets hit by big citric, green hops. Bitterness cuts through the malty sweetness. A dense, full bodied red that pulls no punches with a big malt body and the hops to back it up. Mouthfeel is big, chewy and creamy. Goes down smooth with great carbonation. A big brew that manages to still be drinkable. Another tasty one from Alesmith and a worthy one for an anniversary release. Thanks to KingG for the trade."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Thanks to Grant for bringing a growler of this to one of our gatherings. Pours dark brown with only a slight head. Smells of tobacco, cocoa, cherry, hoppy citrus. There are notes of leather and tobacco on the finish, as well as a light roastiness. I love the fact that these guys have a house style and that it comes through so often in their beers, yet everything is still so fresh and interesting. The taste is a nice combo of cherry, tobacco and vanilla, progressing to notes of cocoa, roastiness, and wet earth. A tad sweet in the mouth, but the earthy notes help balance things. Another nice beer from this quite interesting brewery."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I regretted not getting a try of this one last fall. As coconut, especially when toasted, is among my favorite flavors, I couldn't let this one slip by this season. Tried a half-pint of it at Bailey's Taproom, Portland. From Roots' website: \"Toasted Coconut Porter - IBU 25 5.0% A.B.V. A medium Bodied London style ale, with a slight hint of roast malt & backed by the subtle, sweet tropical, hand toasted Coconut Flakes.\" A: Cola brown-colored, actually rather thin. Shines through with an attractive auburn-ruby, but sometimes too much clarity isn't a good thing; it just plain looks thin. A slim sudsy head, with a few huge bubbles that belong in a sink or tub rather than a beer glass. Virtually no lace. S: Dark and toasty malt wafts gently from this one. A bit sweet and just a little earthy/peaty. Pleasant all-around, but never found any trace of coconut... T: My quest for the 'coconut' is on...first sip, nothing. Second, still not there. Turn back to the paper to read some...wait, what's that? Is that...it may be...that's it! Well, not quite so revelatory was the experience, but I can say that given time, it will come. Subtle toasty coconut sweetness can be found later in the aftertaste of this modest porter. The rest of the brew is a decent yet mostly unremarkable brew. Dark and malty, lightly sweet. Just a little earthy and herbal with a faint flavor I can liken best to dry tea leaves or maybe raw tobacco. M: Pretty thin and lacking carbonation. It's not quite 'watery', but is soft and slightly creamy. Body is medium-light. Finishes dry and without much aftertaste. D: Flavors are pretty good, though - once again - I'm disappointed at the subtleness of that aforementioned Coconut. I want to give this a try again (as Geoff at Bailey's told me, he remembered this brew being tastier last year...). Still, pretty easy to drink - a reasonably good porter."}

Some grass floral notes, wildflowers and mustiness as it warms. L: Cloudy orangish yellow, huge white carbonated head, solid retention. T: Semi-sweet belgian malt, some subtle clove and white pepper. Slight peppery bitterness leads to a semi-dry slight musty finish. Some soft honey notes as it warms. M: Highly carbonated, medium mouthfeel. Very solid, worth the price? Not sure. I'll definitely try a few more from them."}

Smells of molasses, citrus (orange/pineapple), caramel, and coffee in there. No alcohol presence. Taste is mostly citrus up front, sweet caramel/molasses in the middle and towards the end, with a gentle alcohol burn on the end. Very pleasant...want to see what happens in a few months. Mouthfeel is full and sticky, good for a barleywine. Drinkability is low, its a sipper for sure. Inviting but only would want to sip this one."}

Btw, great head retention and there's plenty of nice lacing! The smell is lots of grapefruit and just a bit of malt hiding in the background. The taste is beautifully hoppy...grapefruit and some floral notes tickle my taste buds but there's a good level of malty sweetness that stops this from becoming too bitter. Nice medium to fullish mouthfeel here and the carbonation is medium as well. Easy sipping and such a good thirst quencher, man this is a top notch IPA indeed....and.. I notice a touch of grass in the finish and the aftertaste is fairly long but definitely pleasing. Also, despite it being 7.25%abv, I having *no* problem in making the contents of this 22oz bottle disappear. ;^) For shame on me for not getting some for such a long time. It's truly worth the effort to get it *any* way you can because this IPA, imo, is a world class example of the style."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured into a nonic pint. Presents itself as clear vibrant orange/red with a nice white head that falls fast. Smell is pungent malt, pumpkin, and spices. Taste is bold,with a hoppy punch followed by a punchy spice. The first sip is harsh, IMO, but as the beer warms the pumpkin creaminess comes forth. This beer is a grower not a show-er. It gets better as you get into it. A nice pumpkin ale, not in the same league as post road, smuttynose, ST, or DFH GC"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Overall I think this is one of the best mass distributed microbrews. (If that makes any sense). Well balanced, exceptional mouthfeel, and good use of hops. Rich and hazy golden in color, simply a classic APA. I would recomend this beer to anyone looking to define the style."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Sampled April 2007 Pours with a brilliantly clear, cranberry-copper color and is topped by a frothy, initially fat-two-finger thick, light tan colored head. The aroma smells of sweet toffee, caramel and figs as well as a herbal citrus character. Fairly sweet, with a solid caramel malt flavor to it up front. Malt continues on through to a finish that has a dry, toasted grain character to it as well as some continued caramel flavors. The beer finishes with a fair amount of bitterness. As the beer warms herbal hop notes become quite a bit more noticeable, still they are paired with an at times not quite equal, yet in others the dominant note of sweet citrus hop character of orange peel and grapefruit. Touches of biscuits and toasted malt are noticeable around the edges. This beer is definitely past its hop aggressive prime, without a bottle date though I have no idea to its age. Still it is a good tasting brew that is perhaps a bit more malt balanced than when it first started out in the bottle."}
{"label": 1, "text": "22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Unretired for their 20th anniversary for a limited time. Pours a crystal clear dark gold color with a one finger off white head that lasts throughout the beer, lots of little bubbles rising to the top. Sweet aromas of honey and toasted malt with subtle hop aromas. Caramel, honey, biscuity with undertones of noble hops. Mediuim carbonation, light body- a little watery with a buttery finish. An easy drinking beer, well balanced. Would be great at a summer BBQ."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Smells of sweet hops and hints of caramel. Pours to an almost opaque light brown with a light tan head. At first taste the carbonation seems high. The taste starts bitter, followed by a sweeter brown sugar flavor, the bitterness returns but duller and dryer and the final is a sweet aftertaste. This is quite a complex brew with 4 flavor stages. For my taste the bitterness is a little too flat as the hoppiness lacks citrus notes but for the stye of beer this is quite good."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Served room termperature, Brutal Bitter pours a cloudy light amber with a bubbly white head. The aroma immediately brings to mind sweet, hoppy unfermented wort. I've never noticed it before but thats all I can smell with this beer. The taste is sweet and malty at first, than changes quickly to a nice bitterness with a lot of hop flavor. Just like Dead Guy and the Old Crustacean barleywine, if the price were more towards the norm for the style, these would definitely be in my fridge every night."}

T- Very malty, no real hop presence. Some very unidentifiable spices in the background. M- Very easy on the mouth, not too thick, not too thin. Leaves no aftertaste.

{"label": 2, "text": "well, obviously such a beer is totally light blocking. this s@#t is deep. brown sugar colored head that does diminish but leaves a good collar with fun ringlets at the surface the aroma is rich and deep. strong vanilla and oaky currents tag team with the already strong roasted character. great depth here a robust mouthfeel carries a great altitude of sweet and strongly roasted elements. dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, and overall strong caramelization. slight ethanol heat reminds of the %, though dominates nothing the barrel aging of this particular brew is quite classy. amidst a recent flurry of what has become quite a fashionable trend the barrel treatment of this one is exceptional. typically the aging brings a very boozy element (which, i should say, i do appreciate for a number of reasons. i still find those beers imminently enjoyable) that prompts one to ask exactly how much whiskey was added to the liquid. a very tasteful element is added here and the brew's depth is enhanced for it, yet in a mode far more subtle that i have tasted to date"}
{"label": 2, "text": "12 oz, poured into a tall weizen glass. Ideal color for a blonde wheat beer, beautiful and golden. Not much head to speak of - it's straw in color, formed roughly a 1 cm head, and did not last even a minute. Smells good - I enjoy a beer that I don't have to spend too much time sleuthing, and this is a prime example. You get a nice combination of apple, orange, wheatgrass, clove and banana that are well-balanced for your nose. Simple but just right. Tastes as good as it smells, and does not disappoint - confirmation of all that you smelled, well-balanced. Go figure that a brewery from New Jersey could represent with such a decent beer. I liked it from start to finish. Mouthfeel was good - nice level of carbonation, good in the way that all flavors hit the tongue and palate nicely, and finished well. Drinkability was great - I could see myself having many more of these as a thirst-quenching solution. Not so much ABV that it knocks you on your keister, and it went very well with my chicken quesadilla. Looking forward to my next offering from this brewery."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Bottle Dated 12/05 It pours an amber color with a frothy generous head. Earthy aroma hits the nose with a balance of sweet malt and hops. Malt dominates the taste with adequate hops in the back. Finish is a little sweet w/ a little tingle of hops. Very smooth and pleasant, a fine, drinkable ale. Sam Adams does what it sets out to do in this beer; a balanced malt-accented stock ale. I prefer a few more hops and would have loved a little bit more of sting on the end but that is what IPA's are for."}

More alcohol noted, on the sweet side, with more candi apple picked up. I'll give it \"differant\", not my favorite Barleywine of all time...the label says it will become more complex with some aging...Right now its on the abrasive and solventy side. I'd like to try it again in a few years.."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Poured a pale gold with a big fluffy head and active carbonation. Nice floral, citrusy hop aroma well projected by the bubbling head. Taste is watery and simple with no real synergy. The malt is almost non-existent and the hops aren't particularly strong or flavorful either, although they certainly dominate the middle and finish. Hop oils atop light beer is my general impression. Body is thin and a little oily, a strange combination. Carbonation helps a little though. I wouldn't buy this again, especially with so many other great west coast pale ales out there."}

Coupled with the exceptional drinkability of New Glarus beers: amazing."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The beer pours a dark copper color with a reddish tint. It is almost entirely translucent with some small groups of bubbles floating to the top of the glass. A thin, one-finger khaki colored head forms and soon dissipates into nothing more than some light lacing. This is really a nice looking beer. Floral and citrus hop-filled notes come to the front immediately and dominate the aroma. Upon further inspection, I can pick up some malt tones. There is also an underlying sweetness present that begs of caramel. The first thing I notice is the citrus taste, reminiscent of grapefruit or sour oranges. The hops also provide a piney and slightly sticky taste. You can tell the malt is there also, but it is tough to pick out as the hops are some dominant. The finish is quite bitter and the heavy hops presence brings a tingling to my tongue and throat. The alcohol is well hidden and provides little warming in the finish. I wouldn't have guessed this was 9.6% abv."}

M: Medium-light body with creamy yet drying feel. Good burn from carbonation with a feel that glides over tongue. D: I found this a hair mellow for a flemish, but enjoyed nonetheless.

{"label": 1, "text": "Dried apricot that appears crystal clear with indirect lighting and significantly hazy with an infusion of sunlight. It's definitely an interesting visual effect. The pale oatmeal colored cap is attractive. It resembles a windswept mesa as it deflates, and leaves a fair amount of sudsy lace behind. There's no shortage of cherry in the nose. In fact, it smells so much like sweet cherries that there's no room left for it to smell like beer. It may not be the overpowering cherry bomb that some cherry lambics are, but there's no doubt what fruit was used. I'll have to give credit to BBC, they didn't do this one halfway. As to the question of artificial cherry versus actual cherry juice, it's sort of in the middle. I'm definitely not as impressed with the flavor as I am with the appearance and the aroma. Whereas the nose is 95% cherries and 5% beer, the flavor is much more the latter than the former. SA Cherry Wheat tastes like what a wheat ale flavored with cherry should taste like (in a general sense at least). It doesn't hang together for me though. The base beer is too grainy and rough and tends to dominate the fruit. It seems to me that a more neutral wheat ale, or even a pale ale, would have been a better choice. I also pick up a faint metallic tang and I can't shake the impression that the beer needs salt. As it warms, the cherry flavor takes on an increasingly artificial, almost medicinal quality. The mouthfeel is light-medium, is slightly chalky (odd) and heads toward watery on the finish. Cherry Wheat may be my least favorite Samuel Adams offering to date. If my memory is accurate, I even thought the much maligned Cranberry Lambic was better. With a major tweak or two this could be an okay fruit beer. In its present form, no thank you."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A 4th of July beer seemed fitting for a rainy winter night. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Telegraph tulip. A :: A fiery, golden-orange glow is consistent throughout, with a fine balance that lies partway between translucency and opacity. Very exciting indeed. Soapy bubbles form a collar around the glass with flings of lace scattered about. Streams of carbonation line the glass. Towards the end of the bottle, a gentle pour yields a cottony head that, upon recession, leaves thick, fluffy lace behind. Definitely worth a second look. S :: Yikes, a little sweeter than expected. Yes, piney hops hum in the background, but the main chorus consists of an aria of overripe pineapple and doughy malt. Blind tastings between AS IPA and YuleSmith Summer would be inconclusive--save for slightly more funk in the Yule. Frankly, in the realm of scent, this one can be classified as a GIPA (generic IPA). T :: The Yule is the prodigal son of the AS IPA--it insisted on wandering into the land of the Imperial IPA, never quite made it, but got really boozy along the way. After a momentary flash of what may be a discernable hop or malt presence, I am broadsided by what tastes like a bitter orange peel soaked in alcohol. It makes your head cock to the side at best, your face grimace at worst. M :: Up front, mouthfeel is notable; however, the initial sparkle of bottle conditioning is quickly sloshed away by an alcohol-warmed mouth. D :: Mischievously drinkable 9-, 10-, and even 12-percent ABV beers are not hard to happen upon these days, so why should I be caught without an umbrella in alcoholic rain with an 8.5-percent IPA? A certain crispness and a firmer hop snap could whip this beer into good standing amongst the great West Coast DIPA's."}

Nicely balanced bitterness is spicy with flavors of pepper and cloves, plus a hint of lemon. Semi-dry finish with a mild lingering bitterness. M: Medium light body feels quite over carbonated. D: Very. Nice session beer that pairs well with food."}

Smells of caramel malts, and has a breadiness about it from the yeast. Reminds me of another beer I can't quite place yet. Contains a hop bitterness and spiciness which is welcome along the warming alcohol flavor/sensation. Big body here which is helped out with a nice dose of carbonation. Big alcohol helps keep a slow and steady pace."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This is a bottle I've had for a little over a year now and was eager to see how it differed from the fresher Chimay's I am used to having. Pours a solid head, but not as big a head as I am used to from this brew. It settles down to a fine lace, which is odd for a brew normally more carbonated. Smell is distinctive grapes, plums and prunes which dominated the fruity esters that abound in this brew. The aroma and taste is almost like an old port, sort of reminiscent of a barley wine or an old ale in some ways. Wow, this beer really ages well. I would recommend setting a bottle of this aside for a year or two the next time you buy some. The fresher Chimay is good, but the older stuff is better. You can't make a bad decision with this brew."}

S: The smell is weak, but its a tad yeasty, somewhat spicy, and I am getting a slight hint of lemon from the Sorachi Ace hopping... T: The flavor is not like a Belgian IPA, but more like a Belgian Pale Ale, or Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Its not hoppy, but it is somewhat bitter. The flavoring is definitely mostly from the malting and yeast, and I am having trouble finding anything unique about the hops used... M: Smooth and crisp... D: A decent brew. I liked Exit 16? The Wild Rice IPA better, but this isnt a bad brew either."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A medium rust/red color in the body, hues of brown and opal. Fairly good sized head, tiny bubbles, some chunks. Smells a bit sweet for an APA. The citrus comes through at the end of the nose, but for the most part it smells more like a lager. A bit of biscuit and pine as well. Taste does not match the smell, which is good. A good balance between the hops and biscuit/malt flavors. The hints of nut are replaced rapidly by the citrus of the hops and their dryness."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Sierra Nevada has a stout? Go figure. Pours midnight black with a small brown head and leaves good lacing around my nonick pint. The smell is coffee like- as is the taste, but the taste also has hoppy overtones. It's kind of like their pale ale with lots of rich roasted goodness. The initial taste is hoppy bitter, giving way to a roasted flavor that lingers. Funny thing is that it is a bit too carbonated for my tastes. Overall, a good brew, and one that I'll definitely have in the future."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A: Very dark red, mahogany with some glowing orange around the edge when held up to the light. Head is a bit sizzly, a bit like the Grand Cru but has reduced down to a half inch of creamy, tan foam. Great color and wasn't expecting much retention in the head. S: Smell is of sweet malts, sweet fruits and the slightest hint of the alcohol. Apples are right up front for me, a bit of an apple cider aroma. Some grape and cherry. The sweetness of the malts is very nice here. Nice bready aroma with sweet yeast notes. Not overly complex, but not overdone. T: Some darker malt flavors come out here, deep fruit character with some alcohol to back it all up. Caramel notes with some burnt sugar and a near molasses like flavor. Guessing this is fairly fresh as the bright fruit notes are quite upfront. Great balance here. M: Drinks just a bit too thin for a scotch ale, carbonation is fizzy and lacks the creamy body I look for in a scotch ale. A bit too sweet, and close to cloying. Lacks depth. D: Drinks way too easy for 10%. Doesn't really drink like a Scotch ale, I muscle my way through an Old Chub and I find myself polishing this off far too easily. I suppose this falls into the dangerous category. Overly sweet and lacks the heavy, sticky body I expect."}

Underwhelming hop or citrus aroma, which is surprising for an IPA. T: bitterness is striking at beginning of sip, almost peppery. Piney over-tones follow at the very back of the mouth. M: higher than usual carbonation; bitter dryness was not pleasing. D: chalky dryness and high carbonation left me wanting to move to a different beer. Overall, by far not the most enjoyable of IPAs. Perhaps it would have been better accompanied by food, and that's something I shouldn't have to say about a beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass. Sam Adams Imperial White is a little difficult to rate because of it's status as \"imperial witbier\" but I have tried to review accordingly. A - Not white at all, more of clear, orangish amber. Two fingers of head rise initially but fade somewhat quickly and settle to nothing, no lacing, likely due to the high ABV. S - Wow, this smells much more like a wit than I'd expected! Moderately strong overtone of coriander rides on huge fruity wheat aromas. Lots of citrus is packed in here as well (orange and lemon) with an ample tropical fruit-like sweetness. Touchs of chalky aroma are noted as well. T - Coriander mixes with a very sweet wheat malt flavor that tastes like a combination of orange, banana, vanilla, and pineapple. No tangy or musty/chalky flavor as in some Belgian examples of the style, just a pleasant and complex fruit flavor. Coriander continues after the sweetness fades and mid to late palate there's a briney flavor going making for an interesting contrast against the huge sweetness. Salt and spice quickly spiral into a rather sudden burst of alcohol, contributing a mild to moderate bitterness and finishing things clean. M - Not something I'm used to in a wit...I can't tell if it works for this brew or not. Solid medium body to be sure, thinning out near the end of the sip. Carbonation is moderate to low, giving this beer a dessert like character. D - To put \"imperial\" and \"witbier\" in the same sentence seems a bit paradoxical, but Sam Adams has managed to make such a thing quite drinkable. The noticable alcohol gets a little annoying after a bit but the rich flavors more than compensate. Probably not the crisp, refreshing beverage one will reach for after a day outside, but definitely a beer worth tasting and exploring."}

Orange peel comes through clearly in the finish. Carbonation is prominent, lending a slight acidic quality, but it also rounds out the mouthfeel nicely. Overall, this is a pretty standard rendition of the style, but a very good one at that. A very refreshing beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A: Pours a clear copper orange color. One finger of off-white head with good retention and lace. S: Nice sweet, slightly overripe peaches-- possibly the best smell of all of these so far. T: Starts with a hint of the peach flavor, but quickly changes to a sort of generic bitter-- not really citrus or pine, just bitter. Not unpleasant, but sort of generic bitterness. Bitterness persists through the finish. M: Medium light mouthfeel, good creaminess. O: Not bad on its own, but wouldn't want this to be the only hop by itself. One more to go, and then I'm going back over all the reviews to see how the pieces, when put together, match up with my impression of the 5-hop brew."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into a pint glass the beer pour yielded a 3/4 finger fluffy white head atop a bronze colored beer. Steady streams of carbonation fed up the sides of the glass throughout the sample. The head quickly fizzeled out to just a sliver worth but some spots of lace formed down the side of the glass. The darkest light beer I have ever scene. Smell is a faint malt and perhaps some slight fruit and citrus aromas ever so slightly in the background. No adjuct grain smell, the predominant aroma is malt. A slight orange smell as well. Little to no hops in the nose. First taste on the palate is grainy and malty. A weaker flavour than the Boston lager with the malt almost seeming to subside with each sip. Fuller (much fuller) than others of the same style, but still weak in body and flavor. No hop presence and the citrus in the nose is not in the taste. A crisp end to each sip, but a bit of a diet cola after taste as well. Light on the palate with ample carbonation. The beer is drinkable for what it is: a light lager. Certainly more so than any other light beer I've had in the style. This is probably my favorite light beer but it still falls short in taste and body from what I like in a beer. It looks the part, but falls short on the taste. Within the style, however, there are few that are better."}

Not overpowering in the scent, but a nice balance. Nice malty taste on the first hit, then a little hoppiness and just a slight taste of alcohol. For a 9% abv, the alcohol is pretty well masked. Nice full body taste with medium carbonation. It feels nice and thick in the mouth and on the tongue. It's darn drinkable for a \"big beer\" at 9%, but I don't think I could drink more than one.

Very little acidity. Very similar to Belgian Red but with cranberries and slightly less sweetness. Wow, what a great fruit beer!"}

{"label": 1, "text": "Meeting old friends for a beer at Grumpy's Downtown & spotted this on the seasonal list; instant woody. Nothing like a new Founders beer to start winding my crank. Launch! If you didn't know any better, you'd think the smallish (10 oz. ?) pour was a Michelob Golden Light. OK, a little more body than that, but not much. Smell was hard alcohol & somewhat stale hops, which suprised me. Looking Glass is one of the few innovative Founders brews that fails to impress. Mostly, this just tastes like an old IPA caterpillar that hasn't turned butterfly yet. The hops are faded, the barrel aging adds some harsh, indistinct alcohol. And it's sweet. Really, this is a mess. Not a bad mess, but I certainly didn't want another sample - & I could drink just about any Founders bourbon barrel beer until my throat closed. Cut above mediocre, but not up to Founders high standards."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Poured into my Wolverine pint glass. Awesome. Pours a clear golden straw color with a cap of white head that fizzles away almost as soon as it forms. This has your run of the mill sweet corn smell. Just as I expected, nothing more to it just sweet corn. The flavor is a lot like the aroma. Sweet corn with a little bit of rubber thrown in to the mix. The alcohol isn't shy here either, it makes a strong burning presence. The feel is light and the carbonation is a little low. Overall this serves a purpose, but not really much of one for me."}

Pale malt, very floral from the lavender, honey and some citrus make up the aroma. If I didn't know better, I would also say there is just a hint of mint in the nose as well. T- The taste is pale malt up front with a lot of sweetness probably coming from the addition of honey. The taste almost has some citrus-like acidity and just enough bitterness to help balance out the high amount of sweetness up front. M- The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. O- Overall, I definitely enjoyed this one much more than I was expecting. Kudos to Caitlin for this solid beer, well done!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Dang, I forgot that I picked this up a couple of months ago: It started to gush right after the cap came off; I hope it's still ok. Nice cloudy orange yelow colour with a 2 finger head of foam. The smell is nice with good caramel malt and some citrus hops...nicely balanced. The taste has that balance as well. Nice hop citrus bitterness up front and then the sweet malt, and some breadiness, moves in and dominates from about mid palate on until the finish where it returns to some good hop bitterness. Yum, this is a very nice malty American IPA that, I think, leans more towards an English style. I say that because I don't think a couple of months would make that much difference in the taste ie the hop profile couldn't have shrunk that much during that time sitting in my fridge. Anywho, the mouthfeel actually borders on full & the carbonation is medium. Head retention is very good and it doesn't lack for lacing. Very nice stuff and 1 that I'll look for again."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pale yellow/gold appearance, high clarity with good, steady carbonation. The head is only about 1/4 inch with minor retention. Spiced lemon zest and a lightly sweetened breadiness in the nose. Very clean aroma. More bready dryness in the flavor, with some more light lemon and other citrus fruit. The flavor sweetens some toward the finish. The body is light but not watery. The touch of foaminess on the palate is enjoyable. I thought this beer seemed light and easy to drink. It was simple without being boring. In a way I like the way New Belgium are approaching their seasonals: not overpowering, easy to drink brews. Unfortunately I have yet to be truly \"wowed\" by anything they have come out with recently either. Definitely worth trying..."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Well...hard to say this is an IPA--virtually no hop--at least not a balanced hop. When pouring this brew, the carbonation was weak, and this came through in it's taste--a resounding flatness all around. Barely any fruit essence, just a nice, smooth pale ale. I could drink a few of these with ease, but this simply doesn't compare to a true IPA."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Slightly opaque yellow body, with white head. Wow! Super juicy aroma is this a white wine or a beer? Slightly bitter, I guess orange peels and biscuits.

Effervescent, thirst quenching. Drinkability: Refreshing. Great summer thirst quencher."}

{"label": 1, "text": "This beer was a bright orange, golden-pale copper color with an even white film as it sat in my tulip. Smelled of bright crisp sourness of orange and lemon zest backed by rye-crisp crackers. Tastes of sour wheat and sour mash grains along with sour and over-ripe fruit followed by a lingering orange zest with an astringent bitterness. Felt thick, frothy and just a little sticky. A good candidate for the cellar, perhaps. Maybe a few years on this one will knock some of the edge off. As far as booze goes, this one's surprisingly sneaky."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Part two from my recent trade with David, thanks man! Enjoyed this one in an oversized nonic. A: Dark amber, with a mild haze and a light khaki-ish head that appears creamy and sticks to the glass fairly well. S: Hmm...I get lots of bready malt but there is also a lot of spices, pine, and sharp pungent hops. A hint of malt sweetness as well...and maybe a touch of alcohol. T: Starts off with blood orange, grapefruit, and pine; middle of the tongue it transitions into the rye and bready malts, and then your palette seems to shift gears as the beer (with a lighter body than I expected) glides effortlessly away and all you're left with is pungent, spicy dryness. MF: Near perfect for an IPA; light body, wet feel, just enough carbonation, and good finishing dryness. O: Really impressed, this is a well crafted beer that does a ton of stuff right. The nose and appearance are all decent but then Bear Republic kicks it up a notch with the taste and mouthfeel. Just top notch stuff in my opinion."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured into a very large mug....held most of the 22 ounces in one single pour. Formed a small dense tan head that didn't last long and left almost no lacing on the glass. Smell was strong in the area of chocolate, coffee and alcohol. Taste was sweet and chocolatey with heavy coffee overtones and plenty of alcohol on the back side. Mouthfeel was VERY thick, with a good bit of alcohol tingle on the finish Drinkability was good. So much so that I was still looking for more after I was finished with the first one....although a pillow was more appropriate."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Deep golden color, clear and thick. Mild/moderate head, little carbonation. Roasted sugars, crystal malt. Hops are light and give a lightly spicy floral fruit vibe. Sticky thick sweet malt: nutty, caramel and toffee flavors, light roast. Hop is light, floral flourishes and juicy spicy fruitiness. Mild carbonation. Warm. Finishes with fruit and toffee coating. Middle of the road Scottish or Amber Ale: not great, not horrible. Ill try it again someday long down that road."}
{"label": 1, "text": "7/9/2011 22 ounce bottle labeled 2011 poured into a Lost Abbey tulip. A: First impression was this pours a very dark brown, almost plum color, but the color is deceiving, as its more a red/brown, almost light mahogany. Great carbonation is apparent off the bat with a nice frothy 2 finger brownish white head. Head quickly fades to about a cm, with next to no lacing left on the glass. S: Lightly fruity and sour, slight oaky aroma, but more funky. Fruits smell of cherries and cranberries. Sugar and light booze, with a faint nose of wild yeast coming through past the tartness. T: Nice upfront sourness, quickly fading to a light sweet finish. The flavor of the beer almost falls flat at first, and has little development past the initial burst of tartness. The oaky barrel flavor is upfront with the sourness as you get a bit into the beer. The sweetness comes out in fruit flavors such as tart cherries and cranberries; definite cranberry on the finish. Sugar is also coming through from the barrel aging. Not lingering really, but the flavors are nice. M: Full bodied and moderately carbonated, with a very light syrupy feel. Its also fairly balanced. Although the booze at 6% ABV is only slightly apparent on the aftertaste, its very slow sipping. O: I was expecting great things from this beer from past memories, but its just not in the same league as Le Terroir. Its still a decent beer, but disappointing when compared with the previous years. Labeling on the bottle touts this beer as aged in French Oak barrels for mouth puckering perfection - not in my opinion though."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A little lacing, single finger head. Murky brown in color. Aroma is weak but standard for most brown ales, mostly sweet caramel.

{"label": 2, "text": "Heard many great things about Great Lakes but my recent trip to Rochester was my first chance to sip some. Appearance - Dark, muddy, almost black in color with a gorgeous head that came up with ease and down with much protest. It left some cool pits on top of the liquid and some nice lacing as well. Smell - The chocolate came across the room at the pour. Coffee grounds are very sharp and forward as well. I can pick up some darkish malt but it is mostly trumped by the coffee and chocolate notes. Taste - There's an interesting bitterness that comes out at the taste, but otherwise the tongue follows the nose. Mouthfeel - Close to medium-bodied with some very slight carbonation. The flavor profile here really sets off the taste buds in the front part of your tongue. A bit thin at parts which was the only complaint. Drinkability - Definetly the best porter I've ever had, extremely impressed by Great Lakes now! Flavor was amazing and I really enjoyed the chocolate and coffee combo, well blended. Looking forward to more Great Lakes!"}

The smell is floral/slightly tropical with a whiff of alcohol. This isn't \"bad\", but is out of style. The taste is even more out-of-style. Honey sweetness with floral/almost medicinal bitterness. Not much of a finish. A touch of alcohol comes through. Light-bodied, slightly coating despite thinness. Not quite as crisp at a lager should be. Not a fan of this one, and I don't know that I enjoyed it as much as the score shows. They tried to do too much, but not enough in the right direction of the style. A bit out-of-control and not the thirst-quencher it should be. A disappointment, especially considering the brewery."}

I usually like GD beers, but I wasn't too happy with how this tasted. Not very boozy in flavor, but I will say it did go down easy. M: Very smooth. It did go decent with my turkey sandwich. D: I don't think I would buy this beer again, because I think GD makes much better beers than this. My girlfriend did like this one however."}
{"label": 1, "text": "It poured a golden amber color and had a dense head. There were some very sharp, piney hop aromas at first, but they soon blew off. I was pretty unimpressed with the flavors at first. Tasted rather flat, but after some time in the glass, the flavor opened up into a nice balance of malt and hops. Very drinkable and refreshing. There is some real interesting hop character, but overall I was kind of disappointed after all the hype I had heard about it."}
{"label": 0, "text": "OKAY, you are probably saying to yourself..why such low marks. Believe me, I LOVE HOPS, that has nothing to do with it. The reason being is that Weyerbacher tends to have a problem with carbonation. The six pack I got, 4 of the bottles were way overcarbonated and undrinkable, whereas two of them were fine and quite enjoyable. I felt like going to the brewery, but I would imagine they are aware of the bottling issue by now. Just be cautious."}

S- Malty, grainy hoppy. Smells more like a strong pale ale than a tripel to me. Not getting that Belgian yeast scent, but you can smell this beer from a mile away. T- Tastes very good, fruitful and candy like, strong grapefruit and sweet raisins. Lots of stuff going on with this beer, and it all seems to come together. M- Sweet and medium bodied. Very nice to sip on. D- Very drinkable, for a beer 9.7abv you cannot taste it at all. Great stuff."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Appearance: The pour is fiery orange with a large white head that has good retention for the first half of the glass until it fades into tiny ring. Smell: The nose is muted, except for the sharp spicy aroma that soon fades, and very green. Notes of sour yeast, and citrus hops are also present. Taste: This has everything in from the aroma and there is an herbal rice flavor much like sake. It's almost interesting, but it falls a bit short. Mouthfeel: The carbonation is lively at first, but it turns a bit still and aqueous. Drinkability: This is a fairly unique brew, but I don't think I'll be buying more anytime soon."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This was an exceedingly dark brown brew that initially had a four-finger brown head. The head slowly turned light tan, then died away over several minutes. Aroma was of rich bitter chocolate and dark, slightly roasted malts. It was a little sweet, but not too much so. Taste was indeed sweeter than the aroma, full of richly roasted malt, doffee notes, and hints of sweet chocolate. A very nice combination. Mouthfeel was excellent... smooth and creamy, yet full of body. Drinkability was exceedingly good. Although I like stouts, I am not what could be termed a stout lover... my favorite style is double IPA, so I prefer much hoppier, somewhat lighter beers... but I could have had another of these, and it was in a 22 oz. bomber."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: Pours like crude oil with very minimal tan head, not much lacing. S: Vanilla, oak, a little lactic like old milk. Some nice pine. T: The first thing that came to mind was dairy. Also vanilla, oak, alcohol, maple syrup. Claims a lot of IBUs on the bottle, but not very hoppy tasting. Maybe most of the hops are used for bittering rather than flavor, or maybe the hop flavor mellows out during the oak aging. I would like to compare this side by side with the regular Yeti. M&D: Good mouthfeel, full body, lots of bitterness. A little alcohol warmth. I am a big Great Divide fan, and this one is yet another reason why. A very good beer that should be sought out by stout and wood-aged beer fans."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This beer is a gleaming, coppery shade of auburn that almost reminds one of autumn leaves. There is an adamant stream of carbonation that seems virtually infinite. The beer's appearance is also well-proportioned: a terrific amount of cream-white mousse tops off the last couple inches and ensures all those little bubbles are packed in air-tight. If you're used to plain, mass-produced lagers than the aroma on the SABL might just knock your socks off. If you're already familiar with what craft beer has to offer then chances are you'll consider it nothing more than average. It has a delicate (but delicious) sweetness with notes of toasty, grainy bread and a 'green' Noble-hop pungency. Mmmm. That hoppiness is uncharacteristically assertive for a Vienna lager (then again this is an American rendition). It lends very subtle - but definite - vegetable, floral and citrusy notes, the result being a patented flavour I can always identify with this beer. The malts, of which there is a satisfyingly sufficient amount, smack of caramel and freshly-baked whole grain bread. It's like a sweet pastry topped with citrus shavings. As well as the impressive amount of aromas and flavours, this has (especially for a lager) a lexicon of textures as well. The cookie-like maltiness, doughy and chewy, is typical of pale and Munich malts. It makes the beer filling and provides a lovely residual sweetness. The Vienna malt contributes a little dose of richness and enhances the depth of the flavour as much as it does the deepness of the colour. It's equally refreshing as it is flavourful. Like the Mrzen/Oktoberfest beers that popularized the style, Vienna Lagers make excellent fall-time drinks. Their crisp hop bitterness and nearly limitless quaffability make them great candidates for those still considerably warm autumn days while the reddish-brown colour, the more flavourful maltiness and filling body make them also well suited to the cooler nights that inevitably follow."}
{"label": 0, "text": "A friend of mine had 5 bottles of this, including a 2002 (does it age or is my friend wealthier than he is smart?), one of which we opened for my 30th. He told me it's very expensive but did not say how much. I felt a certian pressure to enjoy this and I pretended I did, but I did not. Poured with no head and no lacing. It smelt like a forified wine and, in fact, that is what it is. This has no place being called a beer. The ABV should instantly say that it is not a beer and the taste confirms it. I'm not really a spirits man. I appreciate a gin and tonic and an occasional single malt but that's it. The flavours that I got were a scotch-like peatiness with malt, caramel and what tasted like lager hops. This didn't really know what it was. It tasted to me like a cross between scotch, sweet dark rum, lager and pure alcohol. Maybe if this was called something else I would have been more receptive to the taste but to call it beer is sacrilege to me. Can you imagine calling something that was 20% wine? Wine makers and experts would label you an idiot. This should not be on this list imo, hence the very low marks."}

Tastes like some grain and malt, mild sweetness, then a bunch of lingering herb like hops in the back that I don't like in this style. A little out of balance toward the bitterness IMO, but that could be for lack of malt flavor too. Not super fizzy, just about right. Medium slick feeling in the mouth. This is the last one out of the case I bought in October, if that's any clue as to how drinkable it is. I know it's getting near the end of its fridge life, but this one let me down. Although, it seems to have smoothed out since the fall. I was hoping for a nice bready sweet Marzen, but it seems like we want to hop everything up beyond recognition these days."}

Not worth repeating at all."}

Flavor is a very smooth combination of pale malts and a bit of hop flavor and bitterness. Barely enough bitter to offset the sweet.

Great price, too."}

In the taste, starts caramel like and ends with a fruitiness of white grapes, but make no mistake, it is a lager all the way through. A somewhat of a lager bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness and lager notes in the aftertaste. A clean lager and nice fruit notes."}

{"label": 1, "text": "First impression when pouring this beer is \"thin\" compared to other summer wheat beers. Smell has some interesting floral aromas, but again faint and not attention grabbing. Taste was interesting in some ways, but again \"thin\" and with a grainy mouthfeel. Very lacking when compared to one of my favorites, Oberon from Bell's Brewing in Kalamazoo, MI. I had 3 bottles from the 6 pack and gave the others away. Usually I love Great Lakes Brewing offerings (Edmund Fitzgerald, Elliot Ness) but this one left me unimpressed."}
{"label": 1, "text": "On tap at Max's today. The beer pours a honey amber color with good head retention and lacing. The beer smells sweet and spicy on the nose, with some orange peel and light nutmeg. Flavors replicate the nose, and the beer is very sweet, with noticeable alcohol and underlying spice. Still, although this is clearly a big beer, there is plenty of flavor and the flavor (with the underlying wheatiness) is attractive. Mouthfeel is very soft, long and smooth, and drinkability is not too bad for the style. This is a very rich beer with noticable alcohol, but for what it is, this beer isn't bad at all. Very much a sipper on those cold winter nights, this is an excellent winter warmer. Obviously, a little bit goes a long way, and I cannot imagine drinking a bomber of this. Still, this beer is not bad at all."}

Bananas, cloves etc of a typical hefe. Taste: Bigger hefe. Again, more malts. More spice. Oranges, cloves, bananas. Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth. Kind of fizzy for the style. Medium carbonation with a medium body. Ends dry. Overall, it wasn't too much different from the regular, but it was a pretty decent hefe."}
{"label": 2, "text": "On tap at Duckworths in Charlotte, served in a pint glass Pours a dark brown, nearly black. No light is getting through this one. Very nice, substantial tan head, that leaves a respectable amount of lacing. Nearly stout-like in its appearance Smooth sweet chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and a lightly roasted macadamia nut aromas fill the air. A very slight roasted malt aroma as it starts to warm. Virtually no hop aroma to speak of. When first served this has a sweet almost chocolate milk like aroma, as it warms the roasty aromas seem to peak and highlight the dark chocolate, roasted malts and slight coffee notes. The taste is very similar to the aroma. Lots of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and macadamia nut flavors. Very little in the way of roastiness at first; there is some there, but not much. As the beer warms all of the roasty and dark chocolate flavors start to surface. Medium/light bodied and very smooth & silky, the carbonation is spot on. Extremely easy to drink. It is a little \"thin\" for a porter for my taste, not enough so that it takes away from the overall eperience, but I prefer a slightly heavier mouthfeel in a porter. Very nice, overall I am very impressed. I would recommend letting this beer warm a little before you drink it, as it is a totally different beer as it warms; much more complex and flavorful"}
{"label": 1, "text": "My wife wanted to try this one, so I was happy to share it with her. It pours like any good imperial stout, with a deep, opaque brown color and a modest ring of foam. This beer smells absolutely incredible, with an aroma of vanilla and caramelized sugar that is as close to actual creme brulee as I can imagine. The flavor is likewise dominated by vanilla and caramel, which isn't as pleasant as it is in the aroma, and there is also some earthy, dark roasted malts and an undercurrent of booze that don't connect well with the decadent sweetness. The texture is pleasant enough, with a light carbonation to help break up the dense, sweet flavor profile. In the end, though, despite the unique flavor profile, the distinctive, potent sweetness is just too much, and I likely won't be picking this one up again."}

Sweet malt and fresh hop flavor harmonize. Alcohol is detectable, but quite mild. A bit of black tea flavor. Medium bitterness. Dries out somewhat towards the finish, achieving some balance.

I detect, well, blackberries, of course, but also earthy grains and spices. All of the aromas mix together well. Tatses yeasty, fruity, earthy, but also clean.

Mouthfeel seems overcarbonated. Not the creamy smooth mouthfeel I remember. Not as drinkable this time around either. A little harsh going down. And a little tangy flavor that is not very enticing. Dont know what happened. Maybe a little oxidation? Light struck? Where's the bottle date mr Samuel Smith? And what the hell is with the clear bottles! Get a clue! You need to get this beer fresh. Not sure how one can determine that though. Still, a good beer even on it's worst days."}

The taste of this stout reminds me a lot of Bell's Expedition (with I admit, I've underrated), strong coffee, bitter chocolate and boozy. Feel is extremely viscous, heavily bodied, oily and with low carbonation. It would be tough to claim this is highly drinkable with the high ABV and a heavy as it is. An excellent stout, it has it all. I'm not really big on combining beers, but somehow, I feel compelled to mix this half and half with Bigfoot barleywine. Unfortunately, I don't have any Bigfoot around or I'd do it tonight. I will let you know how it was when I do."}

I'll just say that this beer, in my opinion, is a disgrace to the beer world and pretty much is everything you don't want in a beer. The appearance looks like pee, the smell is nothing special, the taste is indeed AWFUL, pretty much like water that has a little bit of pee in it. Nothing to say on the mouth feel other than it feels like water essentially which is pretty boring. As far as drinkability goes, I don't know how people drink this because of how awful it is... Well, I have spoken...Good day and good night!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Serving was from a 12 oz. bottle, from a case purchased Sept. 2006. I also purchased a case each of Oktoberfest brews from Penn Brewery and Stoudts Brewery at the same time, in order to do a side by side by side comparison. The Sam Adams Octoberfest beer produces a deep orange/amber colored beer in the glass, with a relatively short lived off white head. Sheeting was good to the bottom of the glass. The nose is unremarkable, with notes of bready/toasty malts. The flavor to me also had a slighty toasted malt note, very light, but balanced. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side for my liking, and for my expecations of the style (remember that I was comparing this to 2 other Fest brews at the same time). Finish is dry, with no aftertaste. Of the 3 Octoberfest brews I tried, this was my least favorite, but still, it has its merits in its balance and drinkability. Prost!"}

Lightly sweet, smooth medium carbonation. Crisp and refreshing, this is a well-done beer in a middle-of-the-road style. If it is around, I will happily have it, but I won't necessarily seek it out again."}

Little aroma to speak of, though I did catch some grain, and there was nothing in particular that was noticeable in the flavor. Finish was about what would be expected; short and flat. Not sure where the \"cream ale\" reference came from, but it was just another lager to me."}

{"label": 1, "text": "12oz. bottle served into a tulip glass This is my second des Rocs beer of the night, and like the first one the Grand Cru comes hard with the gigantic, gross yeast/protein clumps. They look like genetic mutations. I'm pretty sure there was an entire episode of Fringe based around stopping these things from killing the world's population. These things are so big that the Vancouver Canucks should have been suiting them up at goalkeeper instead of Roberto Luongo. This is the Orbitz of beer. As for the color of the beer, it's a tawny, reddish brown. More red than brown when held to direct light. I poured this beer very, very gently, so as to prevent the man-sized floaties, so I generated next to no head. I won't hold that against the beer, especially considering that my strategy failed. This actually smells damn good for a brown ale! Brown malt meets breadcrusts as the base, but touches of wild honey, cinnamon, and white flowers round things out. Very cool. My only complaint is that the aroma is too subdued. I like what's here, there just isn't very much of it. Of course, as I say that about the aroma I want the very opposite thing done about the flavor. It's too spiced, too floral, too herbal. The malt character gets somewhat lost amidst the aggressive spices. But this is nitpicking. This is certainly an above average Belgian take on the Brown Ale. It ventures too close to being potpourri to be considered \"good\" though. The mouthfeel here, if you can somehow strain the floaties out, is adequately spritzy with carbonation. Perhaps a little hollow in the body, but nothing too egregious. Overall, this beer from Brasserie des Rocs is a vast improvement of their \"Tripel Imperiale\" that I had earlier tonight. This has more unique flavors and doesn't just rely on base sweetness. If you like brown ales then this is something you should go out and try."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Served at a restaurant, from a bottle into a Maudite tulip glass- probably about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Pours a dark copper/tawny with a 1 finger creme-colored head. Cloudy, minimal lacing around the edges of the glass. Smell is a deeply layered apples, game, metal (almost a metallic or rust smell), and spices/pepper. Every time I went back to the glass, I got something different. This I found really a testament to its complexity. I eventually just gave up, writing it off largely as it's own beast. Taste is a rich, lushly opulent and chewy maltiness that bends fruit, spice and game together in the best of ways. A malty structure is supported well by an effervescence that I think would be overzesty anywhere else. Here, it's perfect though. Overall, a fantastic rich roundness that is expertly crafted. Serve a little warmer than I got it, (50-55 Fahrenheit) maybe with steak, ribs, game, venison, or raisins. 96."}

I was reminded of a honey like quality in each sip. There was a subtle sweetness. Overall, a good drinking experience. I will be looking on the shelves for this beer in the future."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Kinda middle of the road all the way around for me. Pretty copper color, but no lacing (strange for something loaded with hops) and barely any head, even after swirling my goblet/cervoise. The smell isn't as vibrant as I would expect for something this high octane. There are pleasant herbal, floral hoppy scents but I expect more of a punch from a double IPA. Same deal with the flavor, with an added subtraction (if such a thing is possible) of a metallic edge to the finish. The malts are on the thin side; they function more as background noise than anything else. Not what I'd expect from a celebratory beer. Maybe the next anniversary will be better."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The beer is orange with a finger of off white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is of heavy alcohol, malt, pine, and hops. Smells strong. To quote Joe Jackson: \"the flavor is that of a wet dog after an early spring rainstorm. The finish is long, hard and turgid.\" Fairly sweet with a lot of alcohol and hops, the finish brings warming alcohol with some hop bitterness. The flavor is decent, but not what usually comes to mind when considering the DIPA style. Intense and bold with a formidable malt bill, this is reminiscent of an American strong ale or barleywine in many regards. Overall, a powerful, full flavored brew that will intoxicate you quickly if you're not careful."}
{"label": 0, "text": "A - Dark brown and slightly opaque. Would expect a slightly darker beer for an imperial stout. S- Lots of vanilla, not much in the way of roasted malts that I would expect in an imperial stout. And it is an extract vanilla smell, not something you would get from whole beans. T - Good freakin' god, this might be the sweetest beer I have ever had. Vanilla and more vanilla, sugar and some alcohol heat. I can feel my teeth rotting. There is nearly no malt or hop presence in the taste. M - Despite looking a little on the thin side, the mouthfeel is pretty good. Right where an imperial stout should be in my opinion, if not a little bit light. D - This would be a much more drinkable beer if the vanilla wasnt so overpowering. While not quite a drain pour, I don't think I will be getting this one again."}

Deep, complex aromatic tones. Rum-soaked raisins, plum, oak, vanilla, hints of soft spices, faint grape notions and a bit of sweet bourbon. Decent spot of brown sugar. Suggestions of cinnamon. Spicier as it warms. Tastes just as complex, featuring sugars of the moderately-dense variety. Brown sugar and a good spicy character. True to form, the spiciness unfolds over time, peppered with alcohol heat. Whiskey and charred oak (the char being subtle). Raisins and other dark fruit. Really impressive. Full enough feel. Nearly syrupy. Low carbonation. Slick and hot with alcohol; more so as it warms. Long, lingering finish. Overall impression - a bit too hot and almost too sweet but the complexity trumps out in the end."}

Sweet, and not hoppy tasting at all and only a tinsy bit bitter. A little dry tasting. It really does taste more like a glass of champagne. Texture is pretty clean and well-balanced, but a little more toward the watery side. Overall - Not a bad brew. Definitely worth a taste, but not my favorite among the barleywines.

It looks like a condiment at a Chinese buffet, and smells like a condiment at a Chinese buffet. Soy sauce, dark fruit, and bile from the back of my throat. This beer is a definite sipper, if you do anything with it. A rite of passage maybe, but what a fucked up way to introduce someone to rating beer!

A lot of the Triple Bock flavors, but just not condensed like the Triple. Very sweet with a syrupy taste, some spiciness that I think is hop induced. It has lots of maple, a good dash of rum (with alcohol note) and hints smoke; Complex study in dark. Mouthfeel: Full body, rather thick with a solid chew; syrupy. Nice low carbonation level Overall Impression: I think this is the best thing Ive had from Sam Adams since the Triple Bock. A lot of similarities between the two, but this is much more drinkable. The only real drawback I see is what I see: the appearance is very murky, almost muddy in texture. This was an aged bottle (1 year) from my friend Pegasus. I can see this one spending time in the cellar. Highly recommended from my chair, a very good beer!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bomber, no freshness date. Tried to drink @ slightly chilled temp, then chilled to brewer recommended temp. A - poured a hazy amber. Almost two finger head with solid retention and good lacing. S - Overwhelming malty and bready, few citrusy hops but not enough to balance the malt sweetness. T - Enough hops to balance the malts, but thats it - very strong malty backbone - clearly a DIPA here, much closer to DFH 120 than DFH 90 as I was hoping, but @ 11%ABV it is a fair expectation. Hop heads would prefer a stronger hop presence to add more power to the hop profile. M - Full, think mouthfeel, not quite syrupy, but close. A bit too much for me. D - HAD to drink cold, @ more than recommended temp was simply to thick. Had to put in freezer (even the glass) after opening to finish. Much more drinkable @ a colder temp. I don't know if I would buy this again, even given the ABV (more in Barleywine territory) I thought it was a bit over the top malty. I have seen other reviews that say it is very hoppy, so maybe my bottle is old? I would prefer a Monster Ale if looking for an alcohol hop bomb or a Rouchefort 10 if I wanted a meal. I am a huge fan of Southern Tier, but I would much prefer a Victory Hop Wallop or even a DFH 90 minute. In the case of the former, it has a much thinner mouthfeel, and as a result a stronger hop flavor. The DFH 90 is more along the lines of this brew, but with a little stronger hop profile. Fairly sure this is an old bottle. Will give it another chance and review again."}

Taste: Some caramel sweetness, with a hint of nutmeg, which is countered by some orange bitterness. Decent earthy wheat taste. It's fairly balanced and pleasant, but all pretty muted. Mouthfeel: Smooth and sturdy, with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy drinking. Drinkability/Overall: It's certainly drinkable, and I wouldn't turn it down if offered to me, but it's just not that interesting.

Sam Adams Double Bock and Kulmbacher Eisbock have more ABV yet they don't burn. M- Almost no carbonation which makes it quite syrupy, which is not a bad thing for some beers but it doesn't work here. D- Not very drinkable. The alcohol burn and lack of carbonation really ruins this otherwise nice doppelbock. I like high ABV beers but not this one. I give it high marks for appearance and smell because it deserves it but that's where the pleasantness ends. Maybe if they upped the CO2 and brought the ABV down to something in the 6.7-7.2% range the flavor might balance out and make a nice brew. I really don't get what's going on with this one as there are higher abv bocks that have excellent flavor."}

A: This beer pours about a 1/2 finger of head, large bubbles resting on top. There is a lot of lacing on the glass, but the head retention is average at best and dissipates pretty quickly. The beer is a beautiful auburn color, deep red and light brown. S: Smells like honey, a lightly roasted caramel malt, and reminds me in some ways of barleywine. I like it a LOT. There is no hint of cinnamon or other spices as the label suggests. T: This beer tastes amazing. It doesn't really remind me of a winter warmer but there are tastes of sweet orange blossom honey, some type of spices which are unidentifiable but not cinnamon as suggested by the label, a well balanced sourness competing with the honey sweetness, and even a mild smooth hop presence. This beer is superbly balanced. M: A little under carbonated and thin it makes up for it slightly in the oiliness from the hops. D: I could drink this all night and not be upset about it. The sourness might get to me after 3 or 4, but it's really solid in this category. My second Great Lakes beer I am noticing a profile among their beers. I'm really liking them. This is probably my favorite winter warmer that I've had by far, but doesn't remind me much of the others I've had so take that with some caution. Highly recommended for beer drinkers and non-drinkers alike! This beer is superb in almost all respects."}
{"label": 0, "text": "I don't know why this beer is in the 100 beers. It is below average at best. Not creamy like a good stout should be. The carbinaton was that of a bottle of Pepsi. I thought that maybe it was me, and maybe I got a bad bottle, but 2 of my other friends had it also. One in Colorado, and One in Ohio, both had the same reaction. In my opinion this beer is way overrated."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This is a very nice classic Irish dry stout. I am a fan of this style of beer. Guinness Extra Stout is my regular beer when out in a restaurant. It is Saint Paddy's Day today and I had to have an Irish Stout so it was the perfect day to try it and I was so looking forward to it I was afraid I would be let down. I was not disappointed. It is classic to the style so there are few bells and whistles, meaning it is nothing super special but it is very good and it hit exactly the spot I was hoping it would! Here's the break down: Appearance: Pours black with a thick tan head and minimal lacing. Smell: Sweet dark roasted malts and a hint of molasses and coffee. Taste: Dark malts and dark fruits. Mild flavor, very gentle. It has a bit of unsweetened chocolate and a bit of burnt coffee in the flavor. A bit of a hops dryness especially in the finish. The aftertaste is very nicely dark and sweet. There is nothing extreme it is simply easy and approachable. Mouthfeel: Medium -full mouthfeel, creamy and nice and dry. Drinkability: VERY sessionable! This is a fantasitc Saint Paddy's Day or everyday beer. If it wasn't twice the price of Guiniess (here anyway) I would replace my regular in the fridge. As it is it is not quite worth the price difference to make it a regular of mine. I do reccomend trying it though if you like the style. Hope this is helpful. Cheers!"}

T-Way to malty, not much oak, there is some bitterness in the finish and alcohol is present. M-Medium bodied, a little flat and once again alcohol is present. O-Like a malt bomb gone bad with some hops thrown in the \"balance\" it out. The hops were not balanced, alcohol was a little over the top and not in a good way (WWS comes to mind for a good way). Not sure if aging would help this baby out."}

Liquid caramelized candy in the nose...the taste builds on it. It's pure heaven...toffee, caramel, and wood undertones. One of the silkiest beers I've ever had. To say it's incredible is a gross understatement. Too bad it is only a 7 oz. bottle. Truly exceptional."}

D: A decent beer if you're going to have a lot. Otherwise, not as good as the other stuff New Belgium puts out."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I've had this one leftover bottle for about six months in my fridge. Might as well drink it to see how an IPA ages. Code : 7271 Lots of small particles on the pour. Still has great lacing and head, not that many bubbles (maybe due to the suspended particles getting in the way?) in my Duvel glass, though. Aroma was fantastic. Lots of sticky sweet fruit .. mainly cherries come to mind, cotton candy, some herbalness, and lots of pine cone. Taste is almost on par with a fresher bottle, just with more hop astringency aftertaste. Lots of grapefruit, pine, typical IPA flavors. Leaves my tongue feeling a bit dry at the end. This one is almost going into double IPA actually with the sweetness. The astringency from the hops deteriorating kinda take away from the mouthfeel and drinkability here. Still a top notch beer and better than many other brewer's IPAs. I definitely prefer the fresher version and can't wait 'til this year's batch."}

S: Grapefruit, pine, a little lemon zest, some floral notes as well. Pretty pungent. T: Somewhat faded hop profile, there's the remnants of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. It's definitely a shell what I imagine it was fresh. There's a little astringency/bitterness on the backend and just a little bit of alcohol (taste and warmth) in the finish. Sizable malt base with a good bit of caramel sweetness. Probably a little too sweet (has that candied fruit taste). Finish is semi-dry. M: Medium body, light carbonation. Stick and resinous, but not all that smooth and certainly not crisp. O: It's unfortunate that this bottle just hit shelves in MA, yet it's already 2+ months old and in a nose dive. I can see how this might be fantastic fresh, but right now it's just a notch above mediocre."}

It has a slight rye flavor, but all bread, biscuit, and caramel malts. Taste: Wow, this beer had better not win. It has more rye and spice in the taste, but then it is all malts. Caramel and biscuit flavors. Again, it tastes like an imperial red that is old and lost its hops. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. It is dry and spiced. Ends fairly clean, but dry. Overall, normally I can drink a bottle of Sams and be alright. This one just isn't drinkable at all. There is nothing that works with this beer. Please don't vote for this beer."}

This is a more mature version of the unearthly, simple and obvious a statement but really the best way to describe it."}

Just absolute chocolate overkill, much like creme brulee is also overkill. Tastes like ST liquified brownies and blended it in with stout. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with plenty of carbonation. Because of the unbalanced chocolate, this was a drain pour. Unfortunately, the last four Southern Tier brews I've had now - Cuvee One, Creme Brulee, Pumpking, and Choklat - have all been drain pours."}

The body is medium, the aftertaste is malted, with light note of hop in the finish."}

{"label": 1, "text": "A blank cork so it must be Batch 1; Sample February 2009 The cork pops out with nary a peep. The beer pours into my 25cl tulip glass with a light carbonation that I am able to get to create a half finger thick, darkly browned head. The beer is quite black in color with perhaps a brown tint to it and it is completely opaque in its darkness when held up to the light. Nice, the barrel character has taken on a significant, sweet, toasted coconut note to it in the aroma. Lots of vanillin is the most dominant part of the nose, in fact it is hard to smell anything else except for coconut and vanillin; at least the aroma is incredibly smooth. Perhaps a hint of dark, roasted malt is noticeable towards the end, but it is quite slight. The beer has a light sweetness to it up front. It picks up a definite tartness in the middle and then the barrel character kicks in, but not aggressively so; a touch of Bourbon spiciness, notes of vanillin and some alcoholic heat that warms the throat as the beer slides down. A touch of roast character adds a bit of bitterness to the finish as well as a charred malt flavor. The mix of flavors and tartness reminds me of burnt, concentrated plums towards the middle. The barrel also brings out a nice, toasted coconut flavor. This is pretty light bodied for an Imperial Stout of this strength; it can be a little thin with the alcohol warming in the finish. Not a bad beer, I really like that the barrel character is fairly smooth all around and has lots of vanillin and coconut character. The beer is a bit thin though, it could definitely use a bit more viscous heft and richness; the additional body would work perfectly with the slight carbonation that this beer has too and would help to balance the burnt acidity and sharp roast character a bit more."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours equal part brown and amber with a thick looking off-white head. Lacing really sticks to the glass and the head retention is good as well. Aroma was lacking. Had to reach to get a bit of caramel, some earthy hops and spice. Earthy flavor. Initially a bit of sweet toffee/caramel malt, but bitter earthy hops and a bit of spice push the malt to the background. Interesting blend. Thick, creamy mouthfeel."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours out very transparent golden yellow with a big-bubbled white head. Head fizzles out quickly and there's no lacing. There's a \"green-bottle\" funk in the odor accompanied by the smell of Cheerios. Tastes like how a can of corn smells... If that makes any sense. There's a cereal kind of essence to the tastes as well. Pretty watery but there's a decent semi-clean aftertaste. It's an OK beer. On par with any other Bud type beer I suppose."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a cloudy, bright, straw-colored light amber. Beautiful two finger creamy head. Very persistent and leaves excellent lacing. Well carbonated. Very nice looking...Like Sophie Marceau (yea, yea I know she's not Quebecoise...get over it)...Elegant, beautiful and timeless... Aromas are chock full of good stuff...I get sweet malt and Belgian yeastiness right away - very robust. Some coriander...Some fresher notes, too, like lemonade way in the back. Nice and balanced...This is looking like a World class ale so far... Flavor is luscious, like Sophie's very feminine body...The head and body of this beer are creamy and flavorful...Carbonation swells up initially, but there is a fine malty creamy texture to it that is a pleasure to feel. This gives way to an early middle that starts off tangy, and then immediately moves into a warm series of flavors: nice malt component balanced very nicely by the yeast...they meld in perfect harmony. This is a less spicy version of a Belgian ale...But something about it is more subtle and nuanced. The malt and yeast dance around a little, until they finally give way to a slightly hoppy and understated bitterness that lingers for a good long time. Excellent beer. It's around $9/4-pak, so it ain't cheap or expensive. ABV is awesome at 9% and completely and totally masked. This is wonderful and drinkable to a fault. Many people would get very hammered off this ale. It's excellent on all fronts and hardly any fault to it. Must find and drink. Perfect any time of year, also... What I like most: The beautiful, nuanced flavor profile, beautiful appearance, wonderful nose...pretty much everything. What I like least: the price, and just barely a fault here. Verdict: World class ale from Chamble, Quebec. Absolutely must find."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Served in an Ayinger Celebrator doppelbock glass. Pours a hazy brown, darker toward the center, giving it a sort of heavy apple cider appearance. The tannish head is short (less than a finger) and dissipates decently quickly, leaving a good ring of lacing. The smell is somewhat boozy (kinda surprising, considering the alcohol content isn't that high), with notes of oak and caramel, possibly toffee. The taste diminishes the booziness of the smell and brings forth the oak, while introducing some dark wheat and some rather odd sour notes, though they are subdued beneath the other flavors. The tongue is covered lightly and sweetly, allowing for a rather drinkable brew."}

Very dark brown body, I mean very. Black hole is right. Small tan head. Not much lacing. Excellent aroma; coffee and chocolate first, some mild spice, roasted caramel and cappucino maybe. Major milk and bitter chocolates, coffee and caramel, dark fruits and spice. Very pleasant. Kinda smoky. It tends to fade pretty quick and gives a mediocre aftertaste for such a great first impression. Still, excellent. The moutfeel was good, bitter and punching up front and smooth but kinda bland in the back. Overall very drinkable and a good style interpretation from Weyerbacher."}

Presented in the typical \"belgian stubby\" with a goofy looking stereotypical pirate on the label. Pours a dark opaque orange with all kinds of particles floating around. The head is white, minimal, and fizzes away quickly. Smells sweet with notes of alcohol, over-ripened fruit, and honey. Taste has a honey sweetness to it and is very abruptly ended with a crisp bite at the end of each sip. The alcohol is there, but hides itself fairly well in the taste considering the 11% ABV. Everything kind of smooths out as the beer warms up which is typical. Overall, this was an enjoyable, strong pale ale. The taste was somewhat unique, and it would be enjoyable more only if it was a little more complex. Personally I'd stay away from the 750ml bottles from the same lot, had to return a bottle this evening."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured from a freshly filled, co2 purged, capped on foam growler into a standard pint glass This beer is delicious. The hop aroma is out of the park but it doesn't slap you around with bitterness. I really think it's very balanced. It's definitely highly drinkable and the ABV sneaks up on you for sure. It easily holds it's own against any IPA out there. It just smells so good! In a way the hop profile reminds of Sierra Nevada celebration. If you're around the Framingham area stop in and try this one (and their other offerings) plus the guys are super friendly."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Very nice dark brown pour with gorgeous layer of tan head that lingers slightly but leaves very little lacing behind. Smell is dark baking chocolate.

Very good fruit beer, would drink this and the Belgian Red all the time if I lived in Wisconsin."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Having had other great beers from the Erie Brewing Company, I decided to give this Railbender Ale a try. Appearance: Poured into a pint glass. Copper to light red in color. Head is pale with mostly very small bubbles interspersed with larger bubbles. Not a thick head at all, and it didn't last long either, but it did leave a nice ring around the edge. Smell: Caramel, fresh baked bread, and a slight spiciness dominate the aroma. I'm not smelling a lot of hops, so I'm expecting a glass of thick malty goodness. Taste: Biscuits! Bread! Brown butter. There is no discernible hop flavor. The alcohol gives a bit of a kick at the end. I'm tasting a bit of bitter citrus (grapefruit) that I will attribute to the hops (Cascade or Mt. Hood?). The aftertaste starts off grapefruit that morphs back to bread. Toward the end of the bottle I started to notice a very faint raspberry or blackberry note. Mouthfeel: Not nearly as thick as I was expecting. I'd prefer a bit heavier of a beer for one with this much malt flavor. The alcohol is just right though, warming at the end of the taste. Drinkability: The aftertaste lingers a bit too long for me to give this a better drinkability rating. Although the flavor is good, and the aftertaste isn't bad, I probably wouldn't want to have too many of these on my breath."}

Malty flavor, sweet, with tastes of toffee and a touch of chocolate. Again, a touch of earthy hops in the flavor and some heat from the alcohol. Overall, not the best Quad I've had, but an usual take on a brown ale/quad combo."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured into glass chalice: Pours hazy golden with a thin head that almost immediately disappears to a tiny, thin floating patch. A bit less-than-normal-for-style carbonation rises to the top. No lacing sticks around to speak of. This isn't bad in color, but is in need of better head retention and Belgian lace. The smell is of orange peel, grainy malt and banana-like fruitiness. Peppery spiciness gives it a kick with some subtle grass/hay way in the back. The taste begins with a spice kick that subsides revealing orange peel and carmelized maltiness. As it warms to room temp., it reminds me of sugar-coated banana chips and rock candy. An herbal touch struggles to balance out the sweetness, but in the end the candy sweetness wins out. Alcohol dries it out in the finish. Light-bodied, but holds together. There is an initial sharpness from spice and alcohol, though it becomes smoother and more malty as it warms to room temp. It's a stab at the style, and though it has certain characteristics of a Belgian Tripel, it's not the real deal...Even compared to other American interpretations of the style, I'm just lukewarm towards this one..."}

This is a good looking beer. A rich light amber color with foamy head and thicker than usual lacing. While sniffing I manage to dunk my nose in the foam but still detect fruit and a nice roasted malt. The taste is long lasting and very satisfying. My first instinct is malt but then I get a blast of hoppy bitterness that continues long into the aftertaste. The finish is a bit dry but overall mouthfeel is quite good. Not a thirst quencher but still very tasty. This generally seems to be among the higher rated breweries in England if not the whole of the British Isles and this isn't even one of their signature products. Most impressive. I like hoppy pale ales and this one is pretty special, even for the \"specter'd isle\"."}

A fairly big beer with both alot of hops and malts but it feels like it is a bit unbalanced, alcohol is fairly prominent as well. For this style, I think I would rather have a Gordon's DPA from Oskar Blues, but how can you not commend Flying Dog for their efforts?

It was a brown ale. The pour was a nice amber colour with a very small white head. The malt was roasted over beachwood prior to brewing and this is obvious in the smokey & woody nose. The smoked malt was also prominent in the taste but not overpowering. Possibly a hint of smoked ham as well and i mean that in a nice way. This beer was not overpowering in its smokey, maltiness but rather it was nicely balanced and offered a good smoked beer in a lighter, easier drinking fashion. A nice woodiness in the finish."}

T: Huge coffee flavor and tons of sweetness. Some very mild hopping with some citrus in the background. Lots of flavors going on here, although it was hard for me to pick out specific stuff. Some things I thought I noticed were cinnamon and chocolate, as well as a bit of a tart flavor which I assume is from the bourbon barrel aging. MF: Thick, heavy and smooth. This one has tons of warming and a very big alcohol feel. The mild bitterness at the end makes this hard to gulp, so sipping is the way to go. D: Very unique beer. It almost seems like a Russian Imperial stout/barleywine fusion. A heavy hitter with TONS of flavor. It was frustrating for me to not be able to identify specific flavors, but still quite good. With the ABV, though, don't make any plans if you're going to drink this beer. Not at the top of my big alcohol beers, but I'd drink it again."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Comes in a 550ml Bottle, with a label format that Samuel Smiths must have been using for years, a rectangular shaped label with a gold trim, the one where only the background color and name changes for different beers (this has a black background with the words Old Brewery Pale Ale) but always topped proudly by the White Rose of Yorkshire. I carefully dunked the beer, because I like a head on my beer. A big release of dissolved CO2 gives a rather deep, some 4, light brown head in my over size Glass. The voluminous head is a light tan brown color that pairs extremely well with the super clear brown, copper-chestnut colored ale. It really does look the part, and very appetizing. Tops marks for head retention as well it settled (eventually!) to about 1 but more importantly for me it lasted the distance. It also leaves a super looking lace on the glass walls. Nose is rather average in strength, but this is not detrimental for me as it contains a good dose of malt, which a Pale Ale should. Hops are somewhat feint but evident as well. Initial tastes are of sweet malt, an ever so slight almost delicate slightly roast taste, some hops come in towards the end, but the finish is perfectly balanced between the sweet malt and the hops. I swear I get some oak wood, or is it Walnuts? in the finish as well, how can that be? Taste lingers for some time, a sweet very satisfying mouthfeel. A great drinking beer, albeit 5%. Hell, do I wish they would sell this in Cask in England, what a great lunchtime session beer it would make. I could easily demolish a (UK) Gallon of this at lunchtime: screw work in the afternoon. Yet again, Sams do themselves proud, they do not disappoint, do they ever?! As a Yorkshireman myself, they also make me feel proud to be able to drink this high quality beer in the USA. Thanks to Merchant du Vin, a totally inappropriate name for the Importer. I have to tell you - this is THE beer to drink with Fish and Chips !! A truly great English Pale Ale, a taste of home and simply just, well -Bloody Marvellous."}

Mouthfeel is where this one shines, smooth as can be and perfectly carbonated, a light yet creamy quality. drinkability is very high, this goes down so smooth. I really enjoyed this beer, it is something different than the typical hop bomb ales that are very popular these days, so far i have been very impressed with Rogue."}

Sudsy on the edges, but otherwise, completely clear of the white stuff no lace and no stick. Very clean orange hue with some nice, gently ascending action that mesmerizes, though it could have just as easily have been the restaurants atmosphere. Cool, cool, cool as ice notes on nose with some jumpy grapefruit and kiwi aspects. Almost a spicy note on the mouth = white pepper, oregano; great malt base bangs through while hot alcohol cools things in a yin/yang sort of way. A reliable go-to."}
{"label": 1, "text": "11.2 oz. stubby bottle into a wine glass. Had this bottle in the cellar for a while, so I hope it holds up. No freshness date that I can see. Appearance: Pale wheat golden color with nice bubbles and a nice white head that gives some good rings and raindrops room to stick. Smell: Interesting fruit and white wine aromas. Maybe some Sake in the mix too? Definitely some citrus also. There seems to be some sourness somewhere too. Something that I can't put my finger one also, maybe it's the Sake or the fermentation of the rice. Interesting and pretty aromatic overall. Taste: Fruit esters and sourness is what I get mostly, but I'm not sure if there's anything else that I can really describe. Sourness from the red rice and white wine characteristics are here the most. Finish is almost like rock candy sugar with some woody sourness. Still a bit bland in some ways, or should I probably say that I was expecting a bit more overall. Mouthfeel: Fairly good and creamy for a bigger bodied brew. There's a good smoothness and carbonation from the sip to the finish that seems to work really well. Drinkability: Hitachino brews are always so damn expensive, and unfortunately this doesn't cut it for me. It's interesting and easy drinking, but I feel like the complexity is lacking. Again, maybe this isn't meant to be cellared, though it was by accident in some ways. I'd like to try a fresh bottle, but am I going to pay $5 to see what the deal is? I'm not sure."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Decent DIPA. Unfortunately, it doesn't really live up to expectations and isn't a standout for the style. It's a nice looking beer. Transparent, light to medium gold, and a tight, white cap. The aroma is relatively weak, particularly in terms of hops. Hops are floral and a bit piney. The malt is a bit strong, contributing lots of caramel. There's some pepper and spice in there, too. The flavor has too much residual sweetness for my taste, but there's some good lingering bitterness. It's just a bit too simple and weak in hops. It needs more of the delicate hop notes of the best in the style. The beer has some good body, though the sweetness really hurts it for me. It's an alright beer, though not something that I'd trade for again or seek out otherwise."}

The malt, fruitiness and Fuggles hops are blended to perfection. Mouthfeel is full with prickly carbonation. But why oh why are these guys or any other brewers for that matter using clear bottles??? An otherwise fine beer is marred by skunk! This could have been an exceptional beer. I would love to have this cask conditioned. At 5.5% abv. and considering the flavor profile of this brew, it seems more to me like an ESB."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Single 12 ounce bottle bought from Trader Joe's, bottle says best before August 2007. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy yellow/orange color with an inch white head. It smells like lemon, grain and some peppery spicyness. The taste is pretty much the same as it smells, except that there's a slight tangy finish. Mouthfeel is light, and the beer is smooth. Drinkability is OK, it's easy to drink. It's a good choice as a summer beer, I think it could be very sessionable on a hot day. Not a bad choice at all, overall I think it's a decent, non-offensive brew."}

Overall: I remember thinking this was a high quality brew in college. How the times have changed."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a nice mahogany red brown. The nose is slight yet portrays the profile of smoked meats. Its a tiny herald of the flavor that awaits. The head was a short lived somewhat dirty white-tan. In its dispersion, the head left its legacy along the walls of my tasting glass. I find the flavor not particularly robust or complex but quite congenial. I find the smoke element part of the character of this beer and yet somewhat offbeat. The smoke content is quite noticeable and is this beers defining element.. Coupled with the smokiness is a mild hops bitterness with perhaps a squeak undertone of malt. All through my Aecht experience is the current of the smoked house . I have decided that this is this beers signature. Otherwise I cant find the Urbock in it, and w/o the smoke its a ho-hum experience. Nevertheless the entire flavor experience is such that I find this beer quite enjoyable and Id gladly order another bottle. But I wouldnt walk a mile for it."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is a decent, fairly enjoyable lager, but very basic, thin, characterless, and not even \"brown\". Dark gold, just slightly darker than a normal pale lager, it has rather ugly big bubbles, a medium off-white head that soon vanishes to leave a few foamy bubbles. The aroma is mostly bland, vague sweet malt. It is primarily grain with hints of honey and toffee. The taste is very mild but fairly nice, rather like a more full-bodied basic pale lager but with noticeable grain, a hint of pine and hay, hint of brown sugar, and a light but clear alcoholic quality. I noticed no honey in the taste, although as mentioned the aroma had a hint of it. It's mostly sweet with a faint bitterness in the end. Ultimately it's little more than a basic, rather thin, watery pale lager with a light caramel-brown sugar quality. It' fairly drinkable, though."}

Some mild bitter coffee on the finish as well. Mouthfeel: A bit light for the style, on the light side of medium Drinkability: Medium-high Conclusion: This is a pretty tasty American Porter...the fruit/porter combination is done really well, and is not at all fake which is rare for a lot of American fruit beers...the only thing that brings this down is the kind of dry/overly bitter finish."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a cloudy orange with a thin head which retains its lacing very well. The smell is of hops. Nothing else. Kind of like sticking your nose into a bag of hops. Okay, but too sharp for my taste. And, speaking of taste, it tastes sharp and unbalanced. I mean, I'm all for hopped up beer, but this is too piney, and not grapefruity enough. It's kind of like there's no malt backbone available to this one. Mouthfeel is good, but the hops basically intrude. Wouldn't mind trying this one on cask, but from the bottle, it's essentially an infusion of hops. And that's not too interesting once you try it. Sadly. As this one warmed up, it basically became a hopbomb of bitterness not letting up even after my taste buds had adjusted. Too earthy too sharp. Way too raw."}

Nevertheless, this is still a top-notch brew, and very flavorful and enjoyable... I liked sipping on this one, and Unibroue 16 is one of those beers that should be enjoyed over a long period of time... good, sweet, rich mouthfeel with a somewhat average drinkability due to the ultra-rich and extra-sweet taste along with the hefty 10% ABV... good stuff...

Taste is big, bold, and as expected - the combination of piney hops, citrus, and a touch of caramel from the imperial pale ale blend with candy sugar, wheat, and stone fruit from the trippel, carrying with it a wallop of alcoholic slickness. A slow sipper, this one knocks your mouth out on first punch and keeps coming. Delicious, but I can't imagine drinking more than half a bomber."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I revisited this lovely ale again; what a spectacular offering from Rogue. The head is a huge cap of toffee froth and foam. Body is a burnt umber color with a slight hue of garnet. Complexion is shadowy and obscure. The nose is extremely inviting; scents of fresh cream, superbly bitter hops, and a nutty roasted aroma exude from the brew. Flavors of intense vegetable and grassy hop resins cascade the palate, followed by the rich essence of Crystal malt. The astringent pine finish is outstanding as well as warming. This signature Rogue offering is highly drinkable and satisfying. Cheers to celebrating another holiday season with Santas Private Reserve!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Appearance: A hazy golden-amber body with nice tendrils of yeast reaching to the bottom of the glass. Up top, two fingers of bubbly, off-white head that burn out quickly and leave little lacing. The yeast that pours from the bottle is red and looks rather like paprika resting on the head. A Hefe should sport a massive, fluffy head and this just doesn't come anywhere close to that. Aroma: Clove and banana over a sweet, bready wheat base. A lot closer to the style standard than the look, but still not very exciting. Taste: Quite similar to the aroma. Banana and clove-like yeast over a bready wheat backbone. The aftertaste is grainy and fades fast. Not much more to report here. Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied with good carbonation. Dries a little in the finish. Drinkability: A very quffable brew that works well on a Summer's day. Verdict: After a weak start, In-Heat Wheat gained some points back in the nose and mouth but ultimately failed to impress. Unfortunately, it's just a little too thin and bland to really hold my attention for long."}

The beer finishes with a grainy slightly sweet aftertaste. Overall I think I prefer this beer out of the bottle. I've had it out of a can recently and it seemed to have a little more taste from the bottle. Probably just my imagination. Anyways, at the end of the day this is still just another drinkable but forgettable lager."}

Aroma is coffee, cream and sugar please. Bitter up front, although whether from hops or roasted malts, I can't tell. Then a wave of silky sweetened coffee follows. Mmmmm... good. Smooth, creamy, bitter, sweet. Just like a good cup of coffee (Although I usually take mine black.) Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but not bad. Long bitter finish, makes this a beer to savor. Overall, a good coffee stout. Not overdone and extreme like some representations. Just a solid flavorful drinker, yet another jewel in the crown. Cheers!"}

In my Allagash glass as the color ascends from yellow to amber to ruby red to burgundy. Beautiful color. Bill nailed the appearance. Aroma is faint. Really faint actually. Plum, candi sugar, anis, wet earth and a floral hop reminiscent of lavender. Taste mirrors the aroma with earthen plum and black cherry standing out. As faint as the aroma is, the taste is even more subtle. This beer is...too perfect? No flaws jump out at me but nothing special comes out either. If this was in a contest you could check off every requirement and it would probably win in a BJCP competition. It's standard? Kinda boring."}

Crystal clear, and golden in color, this beer sports the typical huge Rogue pillowy head, and leaves a nice lace down the side. The aroma is of floral hops and a bit spicy. Flavor starts off with a smooth malty body which soon develops a pleasant fruitiness from the juniper berries. Slightly acidic with a bit of a hop bite at the end, but a bit of honey sweetness kicks in to make this an incredibly well-balanced beer. Crisp and well-carbonated, but with just enough complexity to make this a great session beer for genuine beer lovers."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12 ounce stubby bottle. Abita bills this as an amber but it pours a little more gold in color. Pretty decent head with a nice amount of foam. Smell is slightly skunky with an unmistakable lager smell. Beyond the skunk smell there's a decent amount of caramel and cereal in the nose with some mineral notes as well. Light mouthfeel, a little heavy handed in the carbonation. Wish there was more to the body of this beer. It just doesn't really stand up, and seems like it's missing ... something. The caramel taste comes rolling in but washes to the sides of the palate and is chased by water. I get that Abita is proud of their water, I'm just not sure if showcasing it in your beer is the way to go."}

The color is its only flaw; the head retention is great. S-Tons of fresh hops. The malt stays in the back. I pick up on lots of tropical fruit along with pine. The booze is well hidden throughout. As it warms I pick up on some yeasty bread notes. T-The bitterness from all of the hops is upfront. Lots of bitter grapefruit and pine hit fast. The grapefruit bitterness remains strong in the back of the mouth. I also get orange rind, mango, and some pineapple in most sips. In between sips there is a tad bit of malt sweetness that remains in the mouth. As it warms a tad bit of booze is apparent, but it is not a distraction. M-Medium bodied and due to the great head retention it is very creamy and smooth. It has a nice crisp, dry finish. All of the hops leave a nice oily mouthfeel. D-A very good DIPA, but the 8.5% will catch up with you. This is one that if you can get fresh you should definitely pick up. Overall this is one of the best DIPAs out there. The $9.00 per bottle limits this a little as I can buy 2 Plinys for the same price. Definitely worth picking up one or two whenever it is released."}

It smells awesome and makes my mouth water just anticipating the first taste! The taste has strong alcohol presence and fades into a citrus hopped smack right in the tasters. The light biscuity and malty taste in the background are nice to be able to detect, but arent as noticeable as they could be or even perhaps, should be. I feel like aging this could make these flavors more balanced, so I will save back a couple bottles for this purpose. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body and unfortunately with the large alcohol presence, the drinkability score wont be what I had hoped. This is still a very nice brew with lots of complexity, yet its unbalanced flavors should come together very nicely with a little more time in the bottle. Cheers!"}

Perhaps part of my disappointment is that this was right next to the Tommyknocker Imperial Nut Brown Ale which I have enjoyed previously. In a rush, I thought this was an oaked version of the same.

I know that my pee will come out the same color as this beer; I'm hoping it doesn't come out smelling like it too. That would be too weird as it always freaks me out when that happens with asparagus. Aftertaste delivers spice, clove. There's a nice medium-bodied creaminess to it, but it might be one of those white beers that could benefit from a slice of orange. I have a rule that states that if you need to put a piece of fruit in your beer to make it taste better, then just drink a beer that tastes better. That said, I'll drink a different beer."}

It was my final selection in filling out a mix-your-six, and the \"BLONDE\" was much more prominent on the label than \"PALE ALE\", thus the reason for my low expectations.

There was a decent head and minimal lacing. S - There was not much in the way of smell from the beer, but it beat the macro brews. T - As with appearance, I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of this beer, but only because I was expecting a \"blonde\", which I took to mean more of a pilsner style. As for a pale ale, it left a little to be desired (I'd have preferred a bit more bitter flavor), but it was acceptable. M - Again, it was decent, but far from great. D - This one managed to overcome the lack of flavor by being smooth and easy to drink."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A - Deep mahogony body with a 2-finger fluffy off-white head that fades quickly to a whispy cap. Not as much lacing as expected. S - Caramel malts and smells of rich dark fruits, mainly cherry with some plum. Much bolder smell as it warms with a bit of fusel alcohol. Nicely sweet in the nose but not sickeningly. T&M - Sweet caramel malts with a nice spiciness from the alcohol to balance it out. Cherry sweetness and other ripe dark fruits such as plum and even some raisin. Lighter in body than I would like. Really lacks that huge maltiness and complexity that other doppelbocks have. Gets a bit bette as it warms. Low-medium carbonation makes this goes down smooth and easy. D - I recommend drinking this at almost room temp. The flavors are much more pronounced at that point. Really easy to drink with no offensive smells or tastes. I just want more body!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Nice weizenbock, pleasing and complex enough but with a predominant sweet banana profile that feels a bit unbalanced. Presentation: 22 oz bottle. Retro hammer in hand seal design around barley sitting on a blue background. Notes style as \"Double Dunkelweizen Ale, and Alc. by Vol. (7%) Poured into a tall weissbier glass. A - Hazy brown pour with dark copper tones. Fair head, a bit short maybe for a brew like this, medium retention and nice lacing. S - Spices, clove driving it with some coriander, a citrus hint, and a sweet wheat backbone releasing banana notes. T - Taste follows nicely and highlight very assertively the banana notes. For now this is the brew Ive had where the banana profile is most dominant. Clove, and sweet wheat malty notes seal the character. M - Medium to full body with appropriate carbonation with a smooth crisp finish. D - It is pleasing, but some of the flavors feel a bit overpowering and out of sync. Worth the experience but one has to be in the mood. Notes: It is a nice Weizenbock but Im not too sure if this is something to be really commended in this incarnation, but it is not an effort to be ignored either."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Hmm, this one was kind of an enigma for me, changing as I went through the glass, served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 01/29/2010. The pour was decent, light golden in color with a decent bit of cloudiness to it that never really did settle out much. Small puff of white on top of the glass faded out quite quickly leaving behind only some light lacing. Aroma is loaded with coriander and lemon zest but is rather one sided to be honest. Still decent with a clean, smooth feel to it, not as crisp as I would have thought but it still worked for it overall. Small dosed of coriander and lemon zest, hints of grass and light grians. Long, bright and lemon filled finish was long on the tongue after the sip was gone. Overall a decent offering and better then I thought it would be although still nothing special."}

Smells.. quite a bit like champagne! Plenty of sparkling wine notes going on. A dry, crisp, woody oakyness that is much appreciated. The taste is very reminiscent of sparkling wine as well... a pretty good dry one that won't leave you with a screaming headache later on. No problem finishin off a 12(.7!) ounce bottle and I don't think the rest of the six pack is long for this world. Now that I think on it, this is what Foster's might taste like if it was actually tasty. Some similar notes here and there but those notes are well played in this brew. Pale ale fans should pay attention."}
{"label": 1, "text": "My bottle was labeled \"Harvey's Historic Porter.\" This is not listed on the brewery's website, and the label does not match what is shown for their porter, the label shows a painting of the brewery, like what is shown for their old ale. After doing a bit more research, this looks like a revision of their 1859 Porter, but I'm not sure if it supplants the basic porter. Poured an impressive coal black. Aroma was red apples with some roasted background. Flavor profile was complex and layered - some sweet, fresh apple juice flavor up front, then thickening first into a caramel and then darkening into molasses. Finished with a roasted flavor and faint smoke. More substantial than the low abv would suggest. Not something I would want a lot of, perhaps a good candidate for fireside sipper when you don't want something quite as forceful as a barleywine or imperial stout."}

They often fall a bit short on the character side or otherwise simply don't have that delicate balance. Brewing a good subtle beer is a true test of craftsmanship. this passes the test but doesn't excel. It's a rather typical looking pale gold with a nice stiff head and faint but pleasant aroma of yeast and malt -- not much in the way of hops beyond the citrus. . The flavor is very well balanced but a little thin and more sweet than crisp as I prefer. Of course, it's a relatively light bodied beer and it has substantial carbonation It's as drinkable as can be and very thirst quenching but it is just missing \"something.\""}

T-When cold, the initial sip is overwhelmingly harsh, not in a bitter hops kind of way, but in a \"this tastes like raw kerosene\" kind of way.

Standard; not bad, not good. Smells very malty; too sweet, really with a mass exodus of malt aroma giving milky, creamy caramel with burnt sugar, praline and a touch of artificial vanilla. Slight metallic hop note at the back isn't enough to lend this gravitas. Taste doesn't have that sweetness. In its place is a fairly bland, dour bitterness. Largely watery, really, with a light cereal grain upfront, develops into very watery mid with whispers of grass and green tea around the edges. Bit of sweet grain pops up again late, which only serves to expose the distinct shortcomings of this beer's bittering plan. There's just nothing to this palate, a real quaff-ten-pints-with-your-mates ale of blah. Mostly thin and watery, slight drying twist towards the back which suggests more hops than does the palate. Can't say I expected much from this, so well done for delivering no surprises, beer. National ale of Wales? Is Wales a nation of blonde pigtailed girls who wear pink gingham frocks to work every day?"}

Rye malt and caramel in the back. Interesting aroma. I liked peppery beers but this one almost made you want to sneeze if you got too big a whiff. The taste was again very heavy on the pepper. Also some bite from the rye. Leaves a little bit of burn in back of throat. Intriguing beer. Wouldn't want more than one in a session and probably not more than couple times a year but would definitely satisfy any peppery beer craving. Overall, a really interesting beer from a brewery that likes to stretch boundaries. Do recommend although avoid if you don't like pepper. Not available here but I'd probably have a couple per year if it was. [OC; tap]"}

Full bodied, well carbonated, smooth but not really creamy. The mouthfeel is just what I want. This is a really solid porter that is great to sip as it warms up. I did not find the alcohol to be overwhelming at all. It is there but not dominant. Nice job with this one."}

There's some hops in the finish/aftertaste, and not enough of them to really balance the malts. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, kind of sticky and coats the mouth on the finish.

This readily shrinks down into about 1/4 finger of frothy retention, leaving some good looking patchy lacing back. The aroma is sticky in the nose with toffee and bread. Some lighter grassy and spicy hops mingle in, along with some notes of lager yest, but the nose here is fairly sweet overall. The taste is fairly strong with sweet notes of toast and caramel. A firm dose of spice and earthy hops helps balance this out, keeping the sweetness from running wild. This still has a bit too much of a syrupy feel to the malts at times. Pretty clean finish on this, with just a gentle dryness remaining on the palate after each sip. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a moderate crispness to it, but that aforementioned syrupy feel comes out just a little too much. This probably makes helps make the taste profile a touch more sweeter than it probably is. A decent little O-Fest here, if not a bit too sticky sweet in the taste and feel at times.

Cinnamon comes out a little more strongly than it does on the nose, and the result is positive. Otherwise, that caramel / toffee malt backbone. Fairly standard stuff. The body is medium, and carbonation is moderate. This is a strong, tasty winter warmer and a good example of the style."}

Poured a darker brown color than I was expecting at all, but it was all good still, decent enough head. Aroma was high on alcohol, tropical fruit and bitterness. Taste was just massive bitterness, easily in the discussion of most bitter ever. But the hop mouthfeel was completely gone. Even though I know the beer was relatively fresh, it certainly didn't taste like it, thick, syrupy and massive bitterness without any degree of hop mouthfeel. This was more like a super bitter strong ale than your typical dipa from Port. Well I guess there was a suspicion about it being old, so that is kinda typical of Port at times."}

Really more of a sweet malt flavor than anything else, with just a hint of hops at the end. Not the most flavorful beer I've ever had. Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth, low carbonation. I usually prefer more carbonation. Drinkability: I can detect just the slightest amount of alcohol at the back end, which brings this category down a bit.

In fact, it looks black unless you hold it up to a light. The head is thin and tan in color. The carbonation bubbles rise from the dark depths of this brew like stars whizzing past the Millenium Falcon as it enters warp-speed. There's a bit less smell associated with DB than I would have thought for such a strong, malty brew. But the flavor! This is immediately recognizable as a Scotch ale as you taste the sweet malts and thinly masked alcohol. I was reminded of Southern Comfort as I took more sips. Sweetness, malts, and alcohol.

I think the IPA won, but the Belgian character was not completely overwhelmed either. The malts were biscuity with just the slightest hint of caramel.

Other smells include toffee, molasses and brown sugar. Taste is also alcoholic, followed by some sweet molasses flavor. Some creamy and coffee flavoring near the end.

{"label": 1, "text": "I had the chance to try this beer as Sam Adams were filming some of the promotional items for this (IE the commercials). Poured in to a Sam Adams snifter, the color is clear orange, with a good amount of foamy white head. The scores of air bubbles in this beer suggest that it is high in carbonation. From the nose I pick up some soft peach and pear notes, mango, baked bread, and a hint of spice. Flavor is dry, yet sweet, with many of the same traits found in the smell, but not nearly as accentuated or clear. As another reviewer stated, it does have a hint of Boston Lager to it (a byproduct of the yeast I am assuming). I also get a minor hint of funk. Like champagne, the mouthfeel is well carbonated, scrubbing the palate well, and medium in body. The alcohol is well hidden, which is a plus given its overall strength. I am not sure where Sam Adams/Weihenstephaner got the idea that this is a new style of beer, as there are others out there (not many, but still). I don't think I would throw down another twenty for a bottle, but it is worth trying given that there are so few examples of this style around. Cheers to this collaborative ale."}

The alcohol isn't that well concealed, it's pretty warming both in your mouth and in your belly. Full bodied and decently carbonated. Drink for me is nothing special. It's a fine beer but doesn't make me want to rush out and buy another one right away."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Cloudy golden liquid adorned by a quickly fading head, leave no lacing however. Smell is a bit sweet, full of slightly sour fruit and light malt. Tastes a bit tart on top and wheaty, followed by light fruits, possibly pear and apricot. Finishes with a spicy note, peppery almost. Goes down easy, almost wish I had another on hand."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured from a chilled 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass Pours a red-mahogany color with a nice billowy pinkish-tan head forming on top to about 2 fingers. Fairly hazy to look through...not too much light peering through. A sweet, floral hops hits my nose. Lots of sugar on the aroma. A bit of a \"funky\" smell as well that is a bit sour, but I can't dispell what that may be. Sipping reveals a big hops flavor that is both fairly bitter, but smooth, not too piney. Fairly bitter up front but sweetens up as it goes down with a bit of alcohol coming through. Interesting to say the least. Good floral aftertaste. Yum! Very smooth ale. Unbelievable actually. Carbonation is so well balanced it's silly! Great bottle of brew I picked up for $5.50...can't do much better than that. Wish I had 2 bottles!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Back in the late 70's this was my favorite beer (How could you pass up a beer that was Fire brewed, whatever that means). Lets give it another try, almost 30 years later. Poured a non-impressive pale yellow color, with modet white head that fell to a thin ring but left nice lacing on the glass. Smell is virtually non-existent. Taste is also very minimal, but at least not disgusting. Finishes easy and refreshing. Good as a spacer, lawnmower beer, or on a hot summer afternoon. Would be a nice beer to pair with spicy wings."}

Stays around for a while but eventually reduces to very slight cap. Leaves awesome lacing. Opaque brown-black color. Aroma is sweet, semi-floral, and malt. Taste was sweet roasty mocha bitterness giving way to slight nutty and unsalted cracker. Light carbonation hits midway, smooth and creamy on the tongue, and finishes wet. Lightly pleasant bitterness and cracker lingers on in the aftertaste. Drinkability is good -- I would find it hard to get tired of this pleasant brew. Very mild-mannered and unobnoxious. I felt like Goldilocks: not too much or too little bitterness, not too much or too little sweetness, but just right. So drinkable this one disappeared extremely quickly!"}

The hop contribution smells like Nobel hops. The taste begins sweet with a little toasted grain and toffee flavor. This is not a very hoppy ale but it is slightly bitter with a slight fruity flavor. The mouthfeel is good. A decent but not notable ale I don't really see any reason I would drink this again."}

{"label": 1, "text": "This is one volatile beer. Quite a bit of pressure behind the cap. First pour was a glass full of foam and foam continued to come out of the bottle. When I finally got a glass of fluid, the color was a pale yellow with a thin cap that hung around for awhile. Not much for lacing. This beer was too messy to give a higher appearance score. Interesting aroma. Very floral with slight hints of spice and citrus. Plenty of wheat malt as well. The flavor is a bit unusual. This is an aggressively spiced beer. Besides the spices there is a minerally quality that I am not a fan of. Hints of citrus and grain as well. Bitterness is higher than other Wits. Not surprisingly this is overcarbonated. Far to fizzy to be enjoyed. This beer was a letdown. After hearing so much about The Bruery, I expected a better crafted beer. I would pass on this beer next time."}

So I wrote to the brewery asking if this was a different beer and was answered that it's the very same and that in the US it's sold as Golden because they can't use the phrase Grand Cru. But something went wrong with my bottle. Sour, actually. The very moment I took off the cap I noticed something wasn't right. No head, no lacing, dark amber brew. Almost no smell. Vinegar-like taste. Sour mouthfeel. I had to throw the whole $9 bottle down the sink."}

Nose consists predominantly of caramel and toffee malts however there is a slight citric zing in there too (lemon?). Taste is quite malty but balanced. The caramel and toffee sweetness is there but there are other layers of flavour. I pick up cherries, vanilla, raisins and yes, some lemon. Mouthfeel was slightly hot but not overwhelming. Medium and tacky. Overall yet another tasty brew from NEBCO. Really enjoyed this one."}

Flavor is thin, bitter and acidic. This misses all of the good things about an IPA, in favor of the negative. No citrus or floral hop presence. No sweet malt. This has a distinct flavor of bitter aspirin. Not impressed, indeed. Mouthfeel is very astringent and somewhat chalky. Thin and acidic. Drinkability is moderate. On tap, in a pub, I would probably get used to the flavor weirdness and put down a few pints. Here, at home, I am glad that I have other, better, options."}

Taste - big sips had big kicks, really interesting beer to drink. Not a big-hop beer, but there were hops that added to some of the lasting heat. Definitely a must try with food, I don't know when else I would drink this beer. I wouldn't drink more than a bomber of this, but I love spicy food - so this is a great beer and brings interesting stories. I will have this again, Cheers!"}

The taste is more malt forward with some nice cereal maltiness, light toasted grain, and some yeasty character. There is a nice pine finish from the hops. Some citrus/tropical fruit but definitely in the background. The mouthfeel is a little disappointing. Somewhat syrupy, seems slightly undercarbonated. Overall a delicious wet hop ale!

The flavor has a bitterness that doesn't suggest creaminess to me. Overall is comparable to a regular American adjunct lager. I am not sure if this is a blend but it has that lager mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. What this beer lacks is a lightness that makes this easy to put a couple away.

Darkest brown with no light penetrating. Nice cascading effect when the glass is tilted. Aroma consists of roasted malts of the black and brown variety, dark chocolate, graham crackers and brownies. Mild coffee puts it's character on every part of the nose. Wow! Very tasty, kind of surprised, complex profile with chocolate chips, french vanilla beans, marshmallow, and breakfast roast coffee with a dash of bourbon. Mouthfeel is silky, thick, smooth and the low carbonation seems just right for the beer. I couldn't tell this beer was any bigger than 6%. Definitely has the big, bold and complex character of an Imperial porter, but remarkably smooth on the palate. Well done!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Props for not being a slave to the style -- ie, this beer is hopped with cascades, and has a flavor profile much different than any other imperial or oatmeal I am aware of. Pours an opaque black with a dense, interminable, brown head that with a touch more dryness would have been a perfect score. Aroma is light cascades. Flavor is not overwhelming, mainly citrusy hop flavors with roasted and caramel malt underneath, and a lingering coffe bitterness afterwards. Mouthfeel is silky, wet and syrupy. Very nice. Unfortunately the syrupiness and unexpected bitterness sabotages the drinkability as it taxes my palate just too much. This beer is more interesting than good -- and Lion Stout already has the medal for that."}

S: Not a whole lot of hops aroma, mostly earthy and spicy with just a tiny bit of tropical fruit. T: Nice malty complexity from the rye: earthy, a little sweet. Not much of a hop note here either, other than a grassy mild bitterness. M: Slightly bitter, a bit astringent and mouth-coating. Not as much carbonation apparent in the mouthfeel as the head and bubble might have suggested. O: A decent beer, but didn't wow me.

{"label": 2, "text": "A 3 year old barrel at a Weyerbacher tasting at Spinnerstown hotel. A hazy, light ale with a fizzy head and constant carbonation. The color and translucence is lighter than expected. The aroma is deep, malty and grainy with a strong booze sense. It has a kind of transparent smell indicative of heavily Rye based ales. The ale is very tasty and with a smoothed out alcohol finish. The flavor is very grain-sweet but not sucrose heavy. It is filling on the palate, very crisp and light due to the rye. There is some hops but it comes through as an earthy bitterness and not a sharp, intensely bitter taste. For the age and amount of alcohol in the beer it is not over powering in any fashion. The mouthfeel is full but not heavy. The carbonation adds a nice balance to the potential strength. It is very drinkable despite the unique herbal taste and strength."}

Does that mean anything? To me it means pretentious crap. They then claim this is filling a gap as a \"refreshing lager for those who would like some flavour with their beer.\" No it's not. it's not refreshing and it's no more flavourful than a puddle on the lawn. And it's not actually from Elora. it's brewed in Oakville Ontario, which is about a 100km drive away from Elora.

Initial appearance was great, but the floral hop aroma soon gave way to a more malt oriented aroma, much like the malt flavor quickly over powered the hop flavor. Though the malt dominated the flavor profile, the beer has a strong hop backbone which doesn't shine through until after you swallow, erasing any malt sweetness from the mouth and leaving a slightly astringent aftertaste, making you want to take another drink. Overall a good beer, not something I'd want all the time, but excellent session beer I could drink all night when I have it."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A hard pour into my Old Rasputin nonic yields a full 2 fingers of fat, crackling bubbles that quickly settle into a rocky finger of various sized bubbles. Color is deep brown with garnet highlights. Looks clear but mostly too dark to see through. Aroma is full of roasted malts, coffee, and cocoa in about equal measure. Just a hint of burnt sugar and caramel in the background. Can't wait to taste this. Roasted malts are right up from, but no acridity or ash. Nutty dryness, bread crust, rye, and pumpernickel highlight the malt flavors. Some herbal bite that may come from hops, but probably just some anise notes from the malt. Solid bitterness locks in with the roasted flavors to soak up any hint of sweetness.Wouldn't mind a bit more yeasty sourness and residual sugar. But it is an American porter. Plenty lively in the mouth and dead perfect body. If you want it thicker than this, go with a different style. Fantastic American porter, probably the best, though I haven't tried them all, obviously. Went great with some mild bleu Kentucky Rose cheese from Kenny's Farmhouse Cheese (Austin, KY), which provided the requisite funk and creaminess."}

It all works very well together and is very clean M: Medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Again, very clean and easy to drink O: This is a nice American-made quad. It doesn't really push boundaries, but the style is pretty cut and dry anyways. It could use a little more Belgian character, but that is simply nit-picking"}

There is some lacing left on my glass. S - I get some faint citrus smells, possibly lemon.. There is some grain mixed in, and maybe light alcohol notes. Kind of lacking for being aged in a whiskey barrel. T - The flavor of dead guy ale comes through, predominately. There's some other citrus notes mixed in, with maybe a lingering taste of alcohol long...long afterwards in the aftertaste. But the aging in the whiskey barrels really hasn't done that much for this beer. M - A heavy/syrupy body with plenty of carbonation.

Mild malt backbone but they are a little thin on the palate, the use of west coast hops makes this different from typical Euro pale lagers, instead of grass or herbs, the flavor is pine. That is a good thing, but the pine has no malts to hold on too, and the flavor is a bit off. Finishes grainy. Medium to light bodied, as a lager should be. Refreshing. Think of this a Sierra Pale Ale's slightly ugly cousin, It's Sierra in lager form, but that just doesn't work out."}

{"label": 1, "text": "BB 12/08, served lightly chilled in Hapkin's tulip-shaped bowl glass. A: dark reddish amber hue, not blond at all! Coming with an off-white creamy head that settles to a thin cap, on top of semi-lively tiny fizziness. S: pretty sour-sweet prune-y and burned sugary, at first quite like what happens to an expired English bottled bitter... After the beer settles, the aroma shows syrupy sweet grains, boiled sweet potatoes, sugar-cane juice, buttery fudge, grassy hops, and random fruit-esters on top of (much) milder notes of tangerine-ish citrusness. Overall, the balance gears towards the rich and thickly sugary side, thus not terribly pleasant to me. T: just like the nose, the foretaste gives out a very thick presence of burned-sugary and candy-ish malts, followed by a lightly spicy bite of yeasts, fig jam, estery flavour of Chinese green-bean paste, with fat-prune-ish and milder citric fruitiness lingering in the end. Semi-dry in the finish along with the sweet grainy edge that simply refuses to budge even until the last second of tasting. M&D: very light in carbonation, medium-bodied, slightly weird in flavour and not very drinkable due to the sickly-sugary sweetness that disturbs the balance. My previous notes of the On-Tap version seems to be much better, and the only thing I can think of blaming for this bottle is perhaps the expiry-date issue. I don't mind trying the bottled version again."}

Swampy bitterness with a vague hint of cinnamon and watermelon thrown in for good measure. Kind of an almond overtone but the swampwater dominates too much for me. Disappointing but drinkable.

A: Pours a murky mahogany color with ruby tint when held to the light. The head is a couple of fingers' worth of light brown foam, which falls over a couple of minutes into a very thin collar around the brew and leaves faint strands of lacing down the glass. The second pour results in more lacing and leaves a clump of foam that lasts indefinitely on top of the brew, which looks quite nice... S: Big on caramel, toffee malt, and dark fruit, but it's also very hop forward with a strong citrus bent to it. Definitely some booze sting in there. T: The dark fruit character really blossoms in the initial taste. I pick up elements of cherry and raisin on top of a thick toffee and caramel malt base. The sweetness pulls into the mid-taste, but you get a dose of contrasting orange rind and grapefruit hops coming into play, as well as pine hops near the finish. The finish is mostly malty, but there is a twinge of alcohol warmth and lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste. M: Sticky and sap-like, but medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. You can feel and sort of taste the ABV though. D: I'd say it's about middling when fresh. A bomber is kind of a bad idea alone and fresh, but I'd certainly enjoy having this again after aging it to let it cool off."}

The beer was a deep golden-amber color with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a strange gasoline-like quality to it. The mouthfeel was medium with an unusual bitterness for an IPA. I would be curious to know what strain(s) of hops was/were used in its production. The finish had the same unusual bitterness, putting me more in mind of gin than IPA. Oof. Somehow, I ended up with more of this beer. I am always down for a re-review, especially when my original numbers are low. It is a slow evening here at home and I am passing the time with beer, as is my wont. Today is T, 22 Nov 2011. An invaluable team member of The CANQuest (TM), Einweizenbitte, sent me a package from his latest foray to China, including two packets of \"Hot Green Peas\", one of which I just opened and consumed. They were not excessively hot, but suddenly a beer is in order. My pour created just under two fingers of thick, rocky, tawny head with good retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose had a minty quality, like spearmint or peppermint. Huh. I was reminded of chewing gum. Mouthfeel was thin-to medium and it was certainly cooling on my heated tongue. It had a definite spearmint-pine taste in the mouth and I began to wonder why my initially low marks. Finish was minty fresh and lingered with hops. I am glad to have had a chance to return to this for a second chance, but I still would not want more than a couple/few. I have definitely had better IPAs, but not as bad as what I said in my initial review."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Appearance: Poured a turbid brown with big cap of khaki foam. Smell: Yeast with muted scents of figs, raisins, cloves. Subtle alcohol. I expected a little more intensity out of the nose. Taste: Raisins, pears, figs, plums, rumcake, slightly spicy - cloves. Mild alcohol presence. Subtle sweetness throughout but balanced by spiciness and finishes dry. Very nice, very complex. Mouthfeel: Medium body with high carbonation tingling the tongue with bubbles. Drinkability: Although complex and with a high ABV, it's very drinkable. But for the cost."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Blanche de Chambly came in a 12oz. bottle with a silver foil over the cap. The lable shows a sunset with a castle overlooking a harbor. It poured a yellow golden haze topped with a pillowy 3 finger head of white. Aroma is yeast and banana. This \"White Beer on Lees\" tastes of citric, primarily of lemons, it's very refreshing. It is quite fizzy as a wit should be, a good palette cleaner. Talk about a BA's lawn mower beer! Is it grass cuttin' season yet? Enjoyed with gouda and wheat crackers after a walk in the woods with Beulah, my dane."}

T- Tastes slightly malty, but mostly just corny and sugary. It actually has some characteristics of a belgian strong ale with the sugary sweetness- pretty gross though in this form- almost sweeter than a soda. M- Alcohol isn't too prevelant for 10%. Very syrupy. O- Is this 24oz can worth the $1.20 I paid for it? I'm going to have to go with no."}

Does not smell like cough syrup, the scent of blackberries are natural. Very good sign here. T: A light malt crispness followed by the sweetness of blackberries, which are not overpowering at all. Very smooth. Leaves you wanting to take another drink. M: Crisp mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. D: This is a good beer to enjoy, but easily more than one can be drank in a sitting. Very refreshing brew from Samuel Adams, and their best beer made with fruit."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a cloudy orange color. Off-white head is nice and lacing is decent. Smells of alcohol and a barnyardy-yeast smell. Very strong Belgianesque. The overall flavor is heavy on notes of honey and deep, toasty malts. Sugary, creamy sweetness that mellows a bit in the finish. The decent carbonation makes the mouthfeel quite pleasant. The slight alcohol burn in the finish reminds you that you are drinking an ale that exceeds the 10% mark. A heavy and funky selection. Not for the casual, everyday kind of drinking. Could serve as a nightcap for a spring evening."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Copper color with a small white head that dissolves quickly down to a thin film. No real lacing. Sweet candy; citrus and light caramel. Nice, if fairly straightforward. Similar to the nose - wheat and candy. No alcohol, a surprise given the ABV. Fine body, a touch thin, with good carbonation. Overall, a nice tripel that I'd drink again. Hides the ABV exceptionally well."}

Fizzy with a big, cloud-white head with decent retention despite the loosely packed, large bubbles. Little bits of lace cling to the glass too. The color is a slightly hazed yellow straw. S - Smells like a Euro lager. Skunky. And strongly skunky. There is a bit of yeast behind the skunk nose. It's very crisp overall. Pale and/or Munich malts with a slight mineral hint to it. T - The skunkiness seemed to fade out and is virtually non-existent in the flavor. Smooth pale malts are complimented well by light, possibly noble, hops that have a faint floral flavor to them. A touch of yeast stays in the beer as well. The mineral hint on the nose comes out here too. M - Light-bodied and fizzy with a carbonation bite to the finish, its smooth-going. D - I was a little scared at first but all seemed to go well. A decent beer that's fairly drinkable but not something I'd ever hunt down."}

T: Plenty of malt, although a little less caramel than the smell would suggest, leaning more heavily on the roasted malt and smoky flavors. Finish is medium length and a slightly dry. M: Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Long time since I've had the pleasure of a Cold Smoke. Compared with a few other top-grade examples within the style, it could have a little more bulk. Nevertheless, a very nice, easy-drinking Scotch ale that is worth a trip to the Kettlehouse taproom if you are lucky enough to find yourself in Missoula."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This brew was bought by my GF last week . I think she thought that since it was in a can that it was from the Oskar Blues Brewery . She has noticed that I have been drinking out of cans insted of bottles . I am grateful that she bought me the sixer . The design on the can is of a hag with blue flames to the left and t he right of her. The can on the bottom says \" drink it it's good \" . There are some numbers next to the upc bar-code which maybe the numbering system for freshness . Poured into a clean pint glass the head is very small . Maybe one finger . Color is of dark apple cider , amber hues . Aromas here are different than the other IPA's , there is not a hint of citrus . To tell you the truth there is nothing that comes to mind when a deep inhale is taken . The first sip is pleasant , a tad watery and there is nice lacing on the glass . Second mouthful is fresh feeling but dry with a bit of tea flavor to it . This was a good buy from Ms. E.W. but it will not be my \" go-to\" when it comes to IPA's . I like the citrus flavor in IPA and this does not have it . It is an average beer ."}
{"label": 2, "text": "On tap. Poured into a Town Hall pint glass. Pours a slightly hazed and murky amber orange color with a 1 finger off white head which settles rather quickly. Fruity aroma, duh right?, with citrus type hops aroma. Sweet mango flavor upfront follows by a nice citrus hops type bitterness. Loads of citrus rind bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Surprised at the lackluster head and poor lacing as I don't recall previous batches being as such, perhaps making a full batch vs. 1 keg at a time has something to do with it or the fact they had to use pasteurized mango puree vs. mango chunks . Really drinkable though. As I have had this several times I feel the quality wavers a little bit between batches. This time the carbonation was less than before probably due to my aformentioned reasons. Still, this is an awesome brew that drinks really easily and tastes great."}

T- Slightly spicy grapefruit/citrus hoppiness, with a very solid malt backbone. Bitterness is moderate. M- Very crisp, with quite active carbonation. Goes down smooth. D- Excellent.

{"label": 1, "text": "I was quite excited o try this beer. It is dark ruby in color and has a slight fruity and spicy aroma. But the raspberry does not come out as much in the flavor as I would have liked. You can tell raspberries were used, but the rich, malty body comes across as a more earthy spiciness. Still this is a good holiday seasonal."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Sampled May 2007 Well I did not serve this hot as I was supposed to, so as a compromise I have served it at a warm room temperature of about 72F (22C). As advertised the beer is quite still, it pours with a dark, opaque, blackened purple amber color. The aroma has a woody spice character to it reminiscent of a root beer or spruce beer. Notes of orange syrup, cinnamon, anise, allspice, sassafras and some cola-like cardamom are noticeable as are a lot of other spice notes that one would generally associate with a dark, sweet, rich spice cake / bread. Concentrated fruit notes that smell quite berry like, perhaps similar to blueberries, touches of cherry brandy, and figs, but ultimately probably a product of the juniper berries. The aroma of this must absolutely explode when heated up as it is incredibly aromatic already. Only lightly sweet, but it is enough to accentuate the juniper berry flavors up front. There is actually very little, it any bitterness here at all and this tends to accentuate the natural sweetness of this brew. Cola-like flavors of cardamom mix with something that reminds me of Dr. Pepper; in fact Dr. Pepper flavors are quite an apt descriptor for the character of this brew. Without any carbonation this beer is fairly light feeling, it has the same heft as a lightly sweet port does, it even has some flavors reminiscent of port. Orange peel is noticeable as well, but it seems muddy, perhaps caramelized or even approaching a browned orange character, if that makes sense. An interesting beer, it certainly would be appropriate as a mulled beverage after a long day on the slopes, but I am not sure if it really fits in to my lackluster lifestyle. Still it is enjoyable and is certainly worth trying."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Not bad, but there are better Winter Warmers out there. Apperance was nice, poured a reddish brown with a figer or so of foam. The head lasted for some time. Looked tasty Aroma, ale yeast was present, along with some fruit, cherry and current. Initially the taste is fruity with the cherry and current flavors coming through, a nice balanced hop flavor is clear throughout the taste (I would assume Northern Brewer or Bullion hops). The balance of the initial flavors is overshawdowed on the back in by strong ale yeast flavors. Mouthfeel is normal, and the drinkability is somewhat lower than expected. Avery Old Jubilation is a very similar beer in flavor, but much better in my opinion."}
{"label": 1, "text": "First of all this is a 7% IPA not 5. Not sure if the beer has changed or if it is a mistype. A: Looks great! pours a cloudy orange amber color. I wonder if this is bottle conditioned? it looks it. Has a sturdy white foamy head on it that reminds me of pancake batter. S: Smells malty...Toffee, Caramel, a fresh ground grainy/wheaty character overall. T: Once again the roasted malts jump out at me first. It has an earthy wheatgrassy thing going on. This beer is most certainly done in an English style. There are hops present but they are overpowered by the malt. Though I will say that it does not finish that sweet. It is a well balanced brew. M: This has a rather creamy mouthfeel for an IPA, but does have just a little prickle to it. D: Too grainy for me to drink that many, it is rather belly filling"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Appearance: It's, well, black. Really black with a helluva head that sticks to the glass just the way you would want it to if it wasn't already doing it. Smell: Has that New Belgium biscuit-thing goin' on. Heavy on the espresso. Malty & tempting. Taste: Getting a bit of the classic belgian yeast strain going on. This is very fruity for it's color. Aside from that, there's a bit of mocha and a healty amount of espresso on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Sits wonderfully on the palate, just a litte thin at the end. Drinkability: A superb outing from one of my favorites. New Belgium has a warm place in my heart, because they're the first real micro-brew experience I had about 10 years ago when I had Fat Tire for the first time. If there is a perfect Belgian style session brew, this is it."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Troegenator pours up with a short lived creamish-tan head that rings the tawny auburn body nicely. The toasty, sweet marshmallow aroma has a bit of a dry, grainy edge to it with some cracker-like maltiness. There's just a hint of spiciness from the finishing hops underlying the malt. Fairly clean, no diacetyl or DMS with just a hint of fruitiness. The flavor starts off rather light with some initial breadiness that carries into a bittersweet, fruity (dates, figs, candied orange), warming finish. Medium-full bodied with a smooth creaminess. Hint of chocolate. This doppelbock from Troegs has gathered a few well deserved awards over the years. Definitely worth picking up a sixer or case for those nights when only a nice, strong lager will suffice. Suggested pairings include grilled beefsteak such as a nice Porterhouse or a hearty beef or venison stew. Here's to the dreaded Troegenator! PROST! Beertracker Taster's Note: Many thanks to Deuane for this fine PA brew!"}

Rich vinous aroma, dripping with syrupy Italian real marachino cherries, dark with caramelization and balsamic. Deep dark brown, with a caramel orange fringe and little head. Carbonation is a little restrained, but will come with time. Bright refined caramel corn flavor, along with toasted marshmallow and hazlenut creams. A very syrupy and rich presentation, but gentrified with the older oaky tones and a vinous quality that lends sophisiticatin to the sometimes brash leading edges. Sweeter, too, but not cloying or longing, as it leaves a crisp cherry finish. Excellent!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Had a few of these on tap this past week at Anam Cara, gets a 5 for drinkability because it was damn good and fresh, and I wanted to have at least one more before we left. Anyway...deep dark tangerine when poured, the hop aroma was awesome and fresh. I actually thought there was a note of sweetness to the hops, it was almost candylike, different, but intriguing. The taste lived up to the aroma, with a full hop taste riding on a solid malt backbone. I thought the mouthfeel was good, with some stickiness or hop resiness present as well. The finish was slightly sticky, dry and citrusy. Very good, would get again, no question. Thanks Dann!"}

{"label": 2, "text": "An exceptional beer. Pours extremely dark, almost black with a short head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves some spotty lacing. The smell is a blend of hops and roastiness with some spicy rye underlying it all. The taste is very deep and layered. Some hops up front, then a deep bitterness from roasting, followed by spicy rye flavors and a little grainy sourness on the aftertaste. Its very dry, but there are cream and dark chocolate flavors here as well. The mouthfeel is medium weight, but bitter tannins and creaminess are nicely in balance. Maybe a tad too carbonated, but very drinkable. A really nice offering from a great brewery."}

I don't know if this recipe has been tweeked at all, but I seem to like this more than the last time I had it (must have been well over a year ago)."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I bought a mixed case of the Sierra Beer Camp series and this was among them. It was pretty good and pretty true to style (i.e. not some \"americanized, less wheaty version). The look was a very hazy, dark amber color with a very active head. Aroma was of both yeast characteristics (banana and coriander) as well as a pronounced malt aroma. Flavor was pretty intense but quite well balanced, again combining the yeast, malt and a definite alcohol presence. Overall, I enjoyed this a lot and am glad I have a couple others in my fridge."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Shared with Budsboy, part of a side-by-side with a regular Yeti after an appropriate sample of the oak aged. Absolutely solid black. I mean Black. Opaque. Black hole. Mocha head, that gets darker around the edges with a gentle swirl. Intriguing. A long sniff starts out roasty, and hoppy, and then, as your breath gives out, woody and slightly musty. Delicious roasty malts, with a hop balance, sort of an opposite IPA. Just a hint of woodyness, and only the tiniest hint of the mention (on the label) vanilla. Very smooth and almost soft, the hop oil helps give it a pleasant smoothness, the roast giving it a slight tang. Full bodied, but not chewy. A side by side to the 'regular' Yeti shows just how smooth the beer is-remarkable. An edge comes off, and makes the original Yeti, an exceptional beer itself, seem unfinished."}
{"label": 1, "text": "22 oz bomber from Hoosick Beverage in Troy NY. Decent carbonation. Cloudy golden orange brown. Lots of great hop aroma. Reminds me of Hop Stoopid, which has an amazing smell. Nothing else quite like it, but this is close. Very piney hop presence which dominates. Taste is bitter, a bit unpleasant. Alcohol present in the aftertaste. Definitely trademark for IIPA. Not as good as Avery Maharaja on a complexity level, but not many others are. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style. Recommended, but not a best-of-style in my opinion. Drinkability is low, typical. That said, worth a try."}

Ample carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass throughout the session, with a small amount of side glass lace around the edge. The head was not too impressive, maybe an inch or so on the pour and fading quickly down to only a thin layer across the top. Looked pretty much like an English ale. Aroma was very grainy, almost musty in smell. Lots of malter bread, and a lot of caramel as well. Had a definite roasted nuts kind of back to it. Very full aroma and very pleasing as well. Not something to be taken lightly, but at the same time also not very heavy. Nice for a good pub ale and quite a bit stronger then most I have smelled in this category..Very nice here, lots of caramel and malt tones that were littered in the back with a tiny bit of English bittering hops. Nice sweetness balancing It all out very very well. I was quite impressed with this one. It was a very full bodied flavor with lots of earthen grain and malt tones. Super smooth and clean would be the best way to describe it. Not too heavy and not very carbonated but still very very good. It was really a nice combination of factors that led to a decent mouthfeel.Great I could have had ano ther with ease when I was done. A rich full feel was just about perfect for drinking. Not a sipper this was a good sit down with the game ale. Overall I was very impressed with this little brew that I really did not even know that I had. It was quite good and defiantly something worth taking a shot at. I would defiantly recommend trying this one If you can, it might surprise you a bit as it comes through with a lot more quality then I thought it would."}

Finally, B-H is taken down. (Funny that Croatia beat them to me...) It pours a clear pale straw topped by about a half-finger of white foam. The nose is very similar to BMC standards: corn, corn syrup, tin, and that not-quite-skunk-but-not-quite-not-skunk-either smell. Boo. The taste is not much better, with that corn syrup bringing some added sweetness to to the otherwise bland and grainy surroundings. The body is very light, with a moderate carbonation and a rather wet feel.

Mike, you are on my list of people to speak up for when judgment day rolls around. Pours black. Thick black, like the lakes around here, which are so ready to freeze at the first solid cold snap. The head is sunburnt tan, really wild reddish tint to it. Purty. The smell is divine, heavy on the chocolate & malts, hold the hops. Bonus points for the both the cool bottle as well as the historical figure...gives my old History Minor a little goose. Marshal Zhukov would have been thrilled to learn he's been reincarnated as this brew. Wow. This bastard has depth like the Mariana Trench. Roasted, firethrower-tarred malts are all over the place, but there's a warm coffee element, balanced out by a smattering of chocolate applause, & a sweet sling of hoppy nip at the end. All of which melds into a single chorus of happy. The balance on this monster is remarkable. None of the tastes or apparent ingredients outweights any of the others, & all seem to insist on complementing one another rather than playing Soviet & Capitalist. Rich, creamy, warming. Really, words fail me. This beer is borderline perfect. I am delighted to unexpectedly have another one in the basement (thanks mully) which I will hold onto for a while. Although I cannot see how aging this would make it any better."}

Overall, very good, would recommend."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Well this beer at least convinced me that Flying Fish does use hops. Pours a crimson red, nice, good head, retention. Aroma was hoppy, not pungent, a bready aroma. Taste, good, delivered on its hoppy promise, alcohol well hidden, good red tinge of the base malts, maybe irish moss. Not overly complex, was hoping for something approaching Loakal Red or Nugget Nectar, but this is a solid second tier amber/red ale for a hophead. Slightly grapefruitish to the hop mouthfeel. Again, at $10 though, it gets docked overall. Better value/quantity choices at that price."}

Slightly sweet with a cereal flavor like peaches 'n' cream instant oatmeal. Some hop flavors enliven it a little. Caramel flavors go along with the more substantial than average body and mouthfeel. There still seems to be a weedy, seeds and stems flavor to this allegedly organic stuff. Slightly harsh vegetable aftertaste, like artichoke. Otherwise, totally forgettable."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Purchased at the UTOBEER stall, Borough Market, S. London. BB 01/03/2010, served lightly chilled in a large Burgundy bulb wine glass. The beer label states that the abv. is 8%, stronger than that reported on this site. A: pours a stunningly thick and frothy beige beer head with superb retention and leaving tight sheets of lace; on top of a reddish brown nectar (quite ruby when seen against light) and abundant fizziness... nearly perfect. S: incredibly sweet-spicy... licorice, cinnamon, star-anise, mint-leaves all approach at once, like a bag of mulled spice infused in Chinese Lo-Ham fruit (Corsvenor Momordica) tea, wrapping in the centre a thick layer of sour-sweet dark maltiness laced with ripe-plummy+star-fruit fruitiness and dark candy sugar... Intensely spicy and distinctive~~ T: a very sweet wave of dark malts overwhelms the palate in no time, but surprisingly light and semi-sharply fizzy in texture; closely ensued by a brown-sugary flavour, sweet coffee, ground cinnamon+star-anise, and black-date/plum preserve like slightly sour and sticky-sweetness... gradually taken over by a restrained (as opposed to the nose) spicy-sweet aftertaste of the above-mentioned mixed-spices, bearing but a light touch of bitter-sweet malts and a residual flavour of preserved berries in the very end. The aftertaste is unfortunately short and rather clean, but not too disappointing in any sense. M&D: a nicely-carbonated texture keeps the palate fresh and light, while the flavour is also less than full to retain a reasonable drinkability. Alas, the overall body is thin-ish and the sweet touch of malts is sort of too much for my palate, even a bit like aspartame in the end. Besides that, this is an enjoyable and distinctively spicy-smelling beer."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Pours super thick jet black with a super dark head almost blood color head. smell - tons and tons of chocolate. Sweet chocolate blows me away. I get hints of graham cracker. Taste - like the nose it has tons of chocolate and once again more graham cracker.amazing! No hints of any spice or pepper. Overall -worth the hype. Amazing. No hint of alcohol. Get it and enjoy."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a fairly dark cloudy orange, very warm and with glinting sunlight coming through. The head is massive, and so thick that it almost feels like cotton candy. Leaves incredible rocky lacing all over the sides of my chalice, and maintains a thick covering over the surface for as long as the beer lasts. Aroma is insanely complex. Subtly alcoholic, which surprised me given its fairly modest ABV. Spices and breads are the dominant aromas. Lots of fruits, ranging from the very dark (raisins and plums) through the light and delicate (apples and bananas), with citrus and gloriously rich sweet malts. Incredible. Tastes bready, musty notes of brett and wild yeast. Spicy as well, cloves and pepper in the mix, with lots of fruits (banana and orange are predominant) as well. Long and sour finish. Mouthfeel is very creamy and nicely carbonated. Full and very warming, superb. Drinkability was incredible for a trappist. I wanted to keep drinking these all night. Nothing warms me up quite as well on a snowy night as Orval does. Gets better every time I have it, and is now one of my absolute favourite beers of all time. Flawless."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12 oz. bottle to a Widmer pint glass, watching the seemingly endless pre-game hype leading up to Super Bowl XLIV. My first from the Brewer's Select Series, thanks to AdamB84. A: Very, very dark - only a slim trace of mahogany trim in an otherwise 'black' beer. Healthy 2-fingers of sandy head, a slow-dropping fluff that leaves a wide-stretched net of lacing. S: Served a little cool, just a few minutes out of the fridge...as such the aroma is mundane cocoa and vague fruits. Warmer, the fragrance is more a musty chocolate that hints at tartness, a little papery, too. T: Initially, a spiced chocolate, earthy and abruptly dry. Something akin to 'cherry', the dark and mildly tangy Bings or Rainiers. Dark coffee, hint of oxidation despite the freshness of the bottle. An oddly meaty, almost briny/salty flavor immersed somewhere; would 'beef jerky' be a bad word to describe? M: Medium feel, al though somewhat slick/oily (and that's a strange thing to say about an 8%+ 'imperial' porter) and that weakens the feel. A lasting malt stickiness, vague alcohol warming. Then more notable 'alcohol' the warmer it gets... D: Didn't really 'get' this beer...it's a hefty porter that doesn't seem as rich or complex as the weight led me to hope for. Flavors are 'fine', aroma and look are 'good'...reasonably likable and worth a try. Glad to have a second bottle; will take this to an upcoming Portland BA gathering and see what others think. Not my favorite from Weyerbacher..."}
{"label": 1, "text": "2009 version. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel goblet with an nice head and some lace. A very pretty dark copper color. Smell is more subdued than I expected from other reviews, and not nearly as hoppy as I expected. Some citrus and pine but also a nice malty character. Taste closely follows the smell. A very well balanced offering. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp with a nice bitter finish. Drinkability is fine - several of these would be just fine with me. Note: I like this better than last year's version."}
{"label": 2, "text": "341 ml bottle. A- Nice head. Beautiful coppery ambre / brown colour. Streams of little bubbles comming up through the beer. S- Pleasant but mild aroma. caramel, sweet with a touch of yeast and smokiness. T- Sweet middle of malt and caramel. Bitter on finish. I found it less yeasty than many Belgian style ales on lees. Made me think of a cross between a Belgian and a British ale. MF- Smooth. Bit of carbonation fiz on the tongue. Pleasant overall. D- A good ale. Moderate ABV and balanced flavour make this an easy beer to drink. One of the best Unibroue's for everyday drinking."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Poured a medium dark amber with very little head. Some lacing as the beer was consumed. Fairly faint smell but traces of malt rather than hops. The taste is quite good- maybe a little too much carbonation at the front of the palate, but quickly some pleasant not too sharp bitterness from the hops and immediately a transition into a sweet malt flavor followed by a some lingering hop taste. The mouthfeel starts a little slick, but quickly drys out and ends up quite refreshing. Hoppier and maltier than many ambers, but eminently drinkable."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Served on tap at BJ's in San Mateo on Nov 6, 2005. The color is ruby to tawny brown with a thin ringed head on top. The aroma is sweet with a holidy spice nose consisting of close and cinnamon. The flavor is full of spices including nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. The malt profile is very thin and more watery than anything. Some light caramel before the faint bready ending. The feel is light to medium bodied. The spices seem to add a bit more texture than this beer could otherwise claim. The beer was very well carbonated from the tap. Overall this was an enjoyable beer but nothing great. It went well with the pizza we were eating but that's about it."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I bought a 6 pack of this @ Martha's in GR- not impressed overall- i have a feeling that this would be a better draft beer, but in the bottle the overall combination was just all off. It smelled wonderful, but then when I took that first sip, the mouthfeel was just thin and lacking in body. When I poured it into a glass, it developed a good head which rapidly vanished- not the full feel of a good porter- it did smell phenomenal- that I will grant- I would give this beer another shot on draft, but out of the bottle, maybe not so much."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Had high hopes for this one. With all the hype and price i paid, i certainly was expecting more. Not a bad beer but nothing great either, for $20 a 750ml i excepted greatness. Poured in a champagne flute. Lots of carbonation, with a good head. Appearance is mostly clear with a yellowish tint with again carbonation noticed. Smells of alcohol overwhelms faint notes of apricot and sweet fruit. Tastes yeasty, bread-like, nutmeg spice character. Finish of alcohol and a touch of sweetness. A little too malt liquor like for my taste but yet enjoyable in other aspects with bread/yeasty champagne like characteristics. I wanted to like this beer and saved it for New Years. Will do my due diligence next time before i splurge on a bottle in this price range. Nice to see collaborations and unique styles of beers being attempted. Overall in a blind taste would give this about a B- with the price-value factor, this falls more into a C+."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Got this at the Fancy foods show. A-Slightly darker than the typical mass produced AML. A nice stream of bubbles replenishes a one finger head with decent staying power. The fluffy head leaves no lace. S-Sweetness(corn?) with that imported beer bitterness. T-Not as sweet as the smell, it actually is quite dry and bitter. Fairly nonn descript but there is enough of a hop bite here to keep me interested. The malt is very light on the tongue with a slightly straw like taste. The grassy hops remain steady all the way through. M-Slightly above a light body with an agressive ammount of carbonation. D-in the end this is an alright beer, doesn't offend and it doesn't thrill. I suppose this is one of the better Indian beers available so if I were at an Indian Restaurant I would probably choose this."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours black as crude oil and is topped by one finger brown head following a medium pour. Head is filled with multiple bubble sizes and has settled to a pretty thin lace after a few minutes or so. Pretty darn good head retention for a beer so high in alcohol. Smell is roasty, sweet, woody, and slightly boozy all wrapped up in one pleasing aroma. Wow! This is incredibly smooth, yet interesting and complex at the same time. I definitely get dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. There's also the smooth thickness you expect from a good Oatmeal Stout. And to top things off...it's aged in bourbon barrels! What more could one ask for? Nice full bodied mouthfeel with a carbonation level that's absolutely spot on. Been waiting to try this for a while, and it's definitely an elite Imperial Stout. Morey's Bottom Line: I had to do some driving as well as some smooth talking just to score a couple of bottles of this. Quite honestly, as good as this is...I don't think that I'd do it again. It's fantastic, but so is FBS, Founders Imperial Stout, Heresy and Ten Fidy among others. If it's easier to get next year, I'll definitely pick some up."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Thanks to jedwards for sharing. 2010 vintage, bottling #3, bottle number 19 out of 240. Pours a murky, reddish-brown with no head, just a soapy skim and sudsy bubbles around the shoulders. Nose is malty, slightly vinous and also expresses figs and raisins. Fantastic flavors - bourbon, vanilla and a buttery quality on a nice malty backbone - dark fruits are interspersed nicely through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light, perhaps a little watery, with a mild carbonation. This is a great beer. I would classify it as being closer to an Old Ale than an American Strong, however. That being said, a truly exceptional beer if you have the opportunity to try it."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bottle from the brewery,served in a small Acero glass. Honeyish colour, no head,no carbonation. Attractive honey aromas, it smells like a braggot. Both honey and licorice are very sweet, and expected it to be more sweet than it was. There was the element of licorice spice. Not very drinkable, but I agree it goes with food, crackers helped. Odd bitterness, not tremendous for the style."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours black with a tan head that dissipates quickly leaving lace all the way down the glass. Smell is spicy floral hops, roast, some coffee and chocolate. Taste is a balance between hops and roast, like they are both fighting to be the dominant taste. Thick mouthfeel with a coffee aftertaste. A decent impy stout, and I'm sure it would be fantastic in a year or so, but I think the hop taste and aroma are to up front right now. I prefer my stouts less hoppy."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Draft at Good Dog. Pours pitch black and completely opaque with faint mahogany edges and a half finger light beige head that immediately settles into a thin ring. Minimal lacing. Intense aroma with a nice balance of sweet bourbon, subtle dry, earthy oak and vanilla with a good amount of smoke. Even with all of that, the sweet malts are still evident with hints of licorice, chocolate and toffee. Impressive. Full chewy body with a nice balance of sweet boozy heat, barrel character, sweet malt and toasty smoke. Lots of bourbon sweetness up front with hints of vanilla and faint earthy oak. This is followed by sone more alcohol flavor with faint yeast. Sweet malt notes follow with hints of bitter dark chocolate, coffee and toffee . Dry rosted finish where all of the smoke is found. Subtle rauch character gives great balance with hints of spicy BBQ, bacon, charcoal and burnt malt. sweet boozy finish that is nice and smokey. Very complex and decently balanced. A bit sweet and boozy but not too much so at 9.2%."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The beer is very dark brown, nearly black with red hints, the tan head is rather small, leaves no lacing but has good curtains. The smell is sweet, brown sugar, burnt bread, dark dried fruits, coffee beans and some licorice. The taste is very sweet, brown sugar, sweet brown toast, plum jam, vinous, almost alcoholic, notes, port, dark chocolate. Little carbonation, very small bubbles, soft, oily, a warm finish. The sweetness is a bit overwhelming, might be better if aged. Might not be the exact beer (no No3 on the label), but probably close, this is a bottled version (250ml) at 11.2%."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Had this on tap several times, excited to try from the bottle. Bottle date: they don't care, so neither do I! A: pours a copper ale with two fingers of peanut head which is thick and sticks around for quite some time. Cobweb lacing. Excellent clarity. Good looker. S: Grapefruit, citric rinds, resin, plenty of pine. This is PNW hop profile baby. The malts are sweet and present, I think this is nice, not great but nice. T: Bitter and earthy, the yeast may play a significant part here as I don't recall this being in the tap version. The malts come through with a hint of metallic flavor. Flavor isn't as good as I recall. Nice, but nothing special.\\ M: Medium bodied with moderate carb. thick slick finish. O: Above average IPA, sessionable and quenching. I would advise those seeking to have a pull from the tap before bottle version."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Dark dark black with a small brown foam. Just the slightest ruby tinge when angled to the light. S: roasted malts, toffee, vanilla, aromatic hops T: extremely well balanced. Bitter coffee rounded with sweetness; complex blend of different malt & hops characters without any of them getting out of line for the style. Alcohol isn't obtrusive at all, but has enough background presence to keep things interesting. Even in the aftertaste you're left with just a weaker version of the whole, not 1 or 2 minor flavors lingering past their welcome. M: smooth, pleasantly full, mouth-coating. Not creamy, but can't really expect that in a RIS. D: very solid rendition all around. A little pricey for a domestic, but this one is worth it."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This ale pours with a clear orange-gold body topped by a medium thick head with good lacing. The aroma is lsightly sweet and very grapefruity from the hops. A slight piney bitterness is also observed. The flavor is bitter and hoppy with a pronounced piney note and a slight grapefruit note. A very slight sweet maltiness lingers in the background. Light to medium bodied and smooth with a slight dryness."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Contents under pressure! The cork flew off this bottle and nearly caused me a mild stroke. Cloudy honey colored with a big snow white head(not the Disney character). This brew had a terrific aroma of orange, coriander and possibly lemon. Flavor was a bit of a let down though and really didn't match the nice aroma I was getting. A bit sour maybe and the wheat malts weren't as fresh tasting as say the Allagash that I love so much. Overall, not a bad Wit. Just not outstanding."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I prefer drinking good Belgians from the bottle rather than pour in a glass. Try it before you knock it. As a 38 year beer drinker, this is a masterpiece of a beer. Like a warm, deilcious treacle toffee with a boozy finish. Delicious and potent. This is one of the greatest beers I have ever tried."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Definitely one of the better black lager beers Ive had in some time. Sam Adams almost always produces a great beer. This beer is smoooth. Not a high ABV for a darker beer, the perfect amont of head, a sweet aroma, and leaves a nice taste on your tongue, but not a bitter aftertaste. Id definitely recommend it, and will check it out again at a later date."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours amber with decent head and lacing. The aroma strongly suggests fresh tobacco leaf, a character that follows through the flavor. The flavor shows some light malt and some slight floral hops, but a slight volatile, buttery flavor distracts from the quality. The mouthfeel is clingy and leaves a slightly sour aftertaste."}
{"label": 2, "text": "To say this is a hop bomb is to underplay how hoppy this monster of a beer is. Poured to a fantastic head and great clarity. Big malty front end which is in well balance with the massive hops. The hops are citrusy, floral, and resiny with a nice bitterness. When I say nice bitterness, I mean it&#8217;s well done and not overbearing. The hops actually feel like they are trying to escape your body after you swallow a sip. Gets better and better as it warms up, so much so that it&#8217;s still amazing at room temperature. Seek this beer out! ~Jonathan Passow"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Thanks to ShogoKawada for this extra beer! Aroma:Grapefruit, peaches, apricots, malt, and honey in the aroma. A little bit of oxidation, and some hot alcohol. Smells delicious. Appearance:Very deep amber in color. Nice light tan head. Taste:It's mildly to moderately hoppy, I'm not sure when this was bottled, but it doesn't taste like 100 IBU. The hop flavors that are there are apricot and peach, other than that there is some hop bitterness that comes through. The hop flavors do intensify a little as it warms. Underlying it all are rich malt flavors. Mouthfeel:Rich and thick body on this one. Also a little bit of hop astringency. Drinkability:I like this one, and I think they are on the right track. I need to try and get a really fresh bottle to try."}
{"label": 2, "text": "500ml bottle. Pours pale, hazy yellow with a one inch head of white, crackling bubbles. The head drops like a bomb, revealing the classic barren surface found with many acid-laced brews. Zero lacing or retention. Aromatics are laced with enticing lemons, lime, husky wheat, and clove-studded apples. White pepper and cut grass follow through. A nice tart, earthy promise. Light bodied with a crisp, almost spritzy mouthfeel. Sharpish and drying. Bright acid with soured fruits start the palate. Lemon pith with a wheaty twang and grapefruit undertones. Zero bitterness with plenty of tart, quenching dryness and lots of lemony pulp. Finishes with a building tartness, lingering lemons, and bright acid. What a great summer quencher. The tartness perhaps steps into sour territory as the jowels lightly salivate throughout the glass. I'd be really interested to see where this one went with some time in a barrel with Brett."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a cloudy amber- light brown with an off white head with decent retention. Citrus and tropical fruits are prominent followed by some pine, light caramel malt sweetness and some bread. Sadly, the taste isn't as lively as the aroma. I will start off with the positives. This beer is very well balanced. Unfortunately I felt that the taste was somehow muddled or subdued, and there was some lingering harshness. The bitterness hit late and in waves, as opposed to steady crescendo reaching curve. Faint orange citrus flavor and pine along with some light mango, bread and caramel. As far as prominent flavors go, its fairly one noted with some supporting players that must have had their lines cut. The mouthfeel was a little disappointing. A little more carbonation and body would have helped this beer out. Felt a little thin to me. Overall a solid IPA, just not one of the better ones I have had. Drinkability is there, taste is another story. Just outstanding? Possibly. However based on the bottle I had it was Just OK."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A - nice rust color S - pumpkin, spices T - mostly spices, but very little pumpkin M - light body, decent carbination O - An average pumpkin ale with more pumpkin scent than taste (an issue I'm having with most pumpkin beers recently). The Blue Moon Fall Seasonal 12-pack was only $11.20 at local grocery store so not a terrible purchase. Better than Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale which seems to get a lot of love."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12oz bottle into pint glass. Darker than other Schwarzbiers I have tried, this one is almost completely opaque with a light brown head. The frothy top settles to a frothy cap. Thick sticky lacing along the glass. Very light aromas, somewhat weak. Light roasty malt and a little bit of molasses. Suprising light in flavor as well. The deep dark and grainy malts are there, but the volume is turned down. Medium bodied with good carbonation. The finish has a light creaminess and a hint of grain. I was surprised to find out how mild the flavor is in this beer. It has no date label, so it's hard to tell how long it's been around. It's possible a little oxidation took place, given that it has a twist-top cap (not as strong of a seal as a regular cap). It has no bad flavors to it, so I can't give it a bad score. Try it for yourself."}

Slight toastiness, but rather weak in both the malt and hop flavor profile. M- Light body with moderate carbonation. D- The aroma was delicious.

Re-visited 10/23/10 A much better beer than the first I had, which in retrospect had to have been old or mis-handled. This is a very solid Pale Ale with a delicious hop and citrus flavor."}

{"label": 2, "text": "A 12 oz bottle from the brewery. A: The india pale ale has the golden light brown color of a bold DIPA with a shroud of haze throughout. Two and a half fingers of white head have left thin wispy patches all around the mouth of the glass. S: The nose is a lush mix of grapefruit and fresh oranges. The citra, dry-hopped to the nth degree, is an inspired hop that really leaves its mark. It goes so far as to overpower the IPA's standard hop and malt bill. T: The strength of the IPA can't be denied, but man the citra does an admirable job of covering it up. The fresh hops are rich and strong, able to drive the flavor with ease. Citrus, grapefruity and orangey, is oily with a nice dose of black pepper midway through. Underneath the citra layer, pale malts frolic contentedly. The star of the show is the hoppiness; what a powerful finish! M: The mouthfeel, peppery and citrusy, has just a little bit of heat to it. Very lively, the overabundance of hops makes the ale zing. D: Delicious! A bold IPA (listed as an APA when I first reviewed the growler) that glosses over most of its intense booziness."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Fancy red ceramic bomber bottle. Capped and heavy as hell. A: Dark yellow color with a fluffy head and a monumental degree of lacing. S: Sugary, caramely and dried fruits. Strong scents that do not lead me in the direction of the normal dead guy. T: Dried fruits, some hops and super sweet caramel. Chocolate flavors abound aside the fruit. Too much sweetness for my take on the this one, almost like a thick honeycomb.the zest of white grapefruits and a herbspiciness. There definitely is a complexity and a lot going on but the sweetness is not up my alley, too much. M: Creamy mouthfell that gets a little bit slimy as time goes on. Coating on the palate with a zip from the alcohol, not too burny though. D: I find myself a bit let down on this, in terms of drinkability and balance of flavor I will stick with the regular dead guy. Not bad but not great."}
{"label": 2, "text": "On tap at the Winking Lizard. Black with a tan, creamy head. 2 finger head, looks a lot like Guinness. Smell is roasted malt, chocolate, and a nice chicory and cream. Taste is good - very nice roast, creamy body, great chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is good for the style, of course I like the \"thicker\" stouts, but this is good. A tad watery but creamy and satisfying. Overall, this went down way too easy. Enjoyable stout for sure."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured into an imperial pint glass, it's a dark brown color. Clear around the edges with an inch-plus of creamy off-white head. Good looking beer! The aroma is a lot of roasted chocolate with just a hint of juniper and a slight hop spice. If I didn't know to look for the juniper I'd probably miss it. The flavor is a lot of the same but the juniper is there a little more and the hops are a little less. Definitely more roasted than expected. This is more like a porter than a winter warmer to me. It's a little thin too, the 8% abv is very well hidden but there is an awkward roasted bitter aftertaste. I was expecting more, I think this is lower on my list from the Beer Camp series."}

Aroma is very citrusy for a hefeweizen, along with plenty of yeasty spiciness. Lots of orange in the flavor, generally a citrus-dominated beer, but balanced pretty well otherwise. Appropriately low bitterness, no detectable hops. Where is that citrus coming from in a hefeweizen? Should be all wheat and yeast. Mouthfeel is very soft, with saltiness on the lips. Drinkability is decent in this style that is easy to get wrong."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Very pale yellow appearance, high carbonation, low lacing and head. Aroma was negligible. Taste, a tad prickly, zippy hop feel, for how nuanced and underwhelming overall the effect on the palate the hops would have. Not bad for summertime for sure.

Sweet and satisfying...something salty would go well with this. Very smooth, moderate carbonation, but it seemed somewhat watery by the time I finished it. Drinkable? Without a doubt.

Great thick coffee and cream head, very rocky and extremely long lasting. Aroma is sweet, like a mocha espresso. Great taste, fairly complex, leaning definitely toward the sweet side of things, to say the least. Some flavors from the coffe family as well, and some roasted malts flavors are notable as well. I think I'm beginning to understand warm weather stouts: thick, sweet and cool, and nowhere near as heavy as cake or the like. Nice, and well worth picking it up."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A first-time sampling for me from this West-Coast brewer. Big Daddy has a light-to-medium golden color, and is clear throughout. Lots of carbonation streaming to the surface. Head is fine, white, and about 1/4\", though thinning fairly rapidly. Lacing is decent as well. Nose is huge and hoppy. I could detect it from afar as I poured the bier into the glass. It is grapefruity, but has a decent dash of toasty malt sweetness as well. Body was a smidge less than medium, and it had a touch of prickliness on the tongue. Taste is loaded with more of the same grapefruity hops. Malt is also present in the form of a bready/toasty, mild sweetness. The hops are quite pronounced, yet don't have an overwhelming \"bam\". Just enough of an edge has been taken off of them. Yet they still linger long on the palate. This is a nice, tasty offering, with thanks going to SamuraiJack for providing it to me!

{"label": 2, "text": "A - Dark, opaque, with a finger of tan head. Smell is okay, but a little bland. All malts/bread. Maybe a faint bit of sweetness at the end. Taste follows the nose - a bit more complex. Malt heavy, initially a lot of breads then fades into some chocolate sweetness. Also a fair bit of char. Mouthfeel is good. A bit light for an imperial stout. Nicely carbonated and nearly creamy. A subtle take on an imperial stout. Not my favorite, but would make a nice introduction for folks that aren't familiar with the style. Also, an excellent value, if you're concerned with that."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Appearance: Amber color with one finger of head that fades slowly with a curtain of lace. Aroma: Big citrus hop nose, with grapefruit, hints of pine and vague spicy-ness. Taste: A light caramel malt base upfront that gets overpowered by wave after wave of bitterness. It's sharp, a little harsh and has a mild phenolic taste towards the back end and a lingering finish. The Rest: This is a pretty decent IPA from a new brewery in town that I have been enjoying a lot this summer. It's a little rough around the edges, but overall pretty tasty."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bottle poured into one of those fancy Sam Adams glasses. Sipped slowly while studying Anatomy -- definitely a good way to help pass the time. A: Pours a deep black with a dark tan 1 finger head that disappears quickly. When I tilt the glass to take a sip it leaves a thick, sticky layer of lacing. I can also see tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. It's kind of mesmerizing to watch. S: I get coffee and a little heat in the back mostly. Maybe a slight chocolate smell in the background. T: Dark malt, coffee, chocolate. There's that alcoholic heat again. I cannot say I'm a fan of that part of it. M: Medium mouthfeel, coats the tongue lightly, great carbonation for an imperial stout -- maybe due to the special Sam Adams glass? Or maybe the feel of extra carbonation is imagined because it is in this glass -- kind of a carbonation placebo affect? Either way, I feel it -- real or not. D: If you can get past the heat this is a a fairly drinkable beer; though I think I can only have one in a sitting. But RISes should be that way, no? Overall, not a very complex RIS. This one is drank best when I don't want to have to think about my beer too much -- like when studying for anatomy. Probably one of Sam Adams's stronger showings and definitely my favorite beer by them. Despite the C+ rating, I really do enjoy this beer. It just doesn't blow me away. A solid slightly above average showing."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Honesty - Purity - Tradition Since 1844 Aahh, Pabst Genuine Draft Style Light I scored this cold filtered beer at the local 99Cents store at a price of 2 for 99. Not a great deal, but they had about 6 beers that i havnt got to review yet, so i laid down 3 bills for the lot of them. A great opportunity to rate without committing yourself to a sixer or a tallboy. now for the rating. This beer poured a light golden-straw color - crystal clear and with a vigerous head that soon dissapated to a slight collor of foam and an island from a stream of carbonation. Looks like an average American Pilsner to me. The aroma has a unimpressive sweetness to it with zero noticable hop smell. I dont think i can detect a maltyness in the sweetness, which leaves me to believe it is a smell powered by adjuncts. The taste is not bad, but not good either. It is pretty clean and has a little less flavor and a little less body than its non-light brethen. It goes down easy and has a little less than average mouthfeel. This is not a terrible beer, mind you. Not interesting, but not offinsive. Kind of like me. I suppose this wouldnt be a bad beer if you were into this kind of stuff or had sand in your mouth. el_mocoso"}

Has a bitter aftertaste with some astringency. M - Moderately viscous with plenty of carbonation.

{"label": 0, "text": "Kronenbourg used to be a great beer about 10-15 years ago until it was bought out by Molson a few years ago. Anything Molson gets its hands on turns to crap, they did the same to Moosehead and Carlsberg. It's a shame, I remember a Kronenbourg with great head and a smooth mouthfeel. This one tastes like an American/imported-macro brew. Very disapointed, used to be my favorite. Plus, I've seen a few reviews out there bashing American breweries. American breweries like Ommegang, Rogue, Anchor Steam...etc., are some of the greatest beers the world has to offer, you just have to not buy your beer at a local grocery store."}
{"label": 1, "text": "750mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a crystal clear amber with a small beige head that lingers for a little while as a thin cap leaving traces of lacing around the sides. The aroma is sweet caramel malts and a bit of dark fruit and a slight toasted character as well. There are a bit of hops in the background but nothing really noticeable. The taste is much more toasted than the aroma and the toasted malts dominate the taste throughout. There are definitely some dark fruits in there as well as some citrus hops that tingle the tongue slightly in the finish., The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation that accentuates the tingly feeling on the palate. As an amped up version of Dead Guy, it's a good beer. I certainly wouldn't call it a dobblebock as it is probably doesn't stack up to the better dobblebocks out there. Either way, it's worth trying."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Drinking this one poured into a goblet. I love SN and can't wait to tastes this mix of their three most beloved beers. Appearance: Murky brown body. Dark at the top of the glass, lighter at the thinner bottom. Very large head on this one that leave generous lacing. Aroma: Hops are the biggest element of the nose. Very piney with hints of citrus, just like what you'd expect from a SN brew that uses PA and Celebration. As it warms, caramel and vanilla oak become more prevalent. Taste: Hops from the nose make a jump to the taste. This is very piney off the top. Then comes the oak and malt sweetness for a very brief appearance. A citrus rind bitterness is the last taste in that lasts on the linger. However, this one changes dramatically as it warms. Yes, the hops are still very present, but the Bigfoot oak and malt play a much larger role. Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied through and through. It is kind of odd to get a barely wine taste in such a body. I appreciate the higher level of carbonation as it allows the three blended beers each to shine as brightly as they can. This bottle was drank at a much quicker rate than most for such a high ABV. Overall: SN made a great beer here to celebrate their three most well known brews. I get the hop profile and body types from both the Pale Ale and Celebration. In addition, the Bigfoot malt comes in to balance things. I could see aging this one to get a more substantial malt if you wanted to, but I think the hops provide balance that would be lost if you did."}

The aroma is very pleasant - a lot of nutty and bready things going on with some caramel maltiness backing things up. The flavor is better than expected. Very smooth. Lots of notes of nuttiness and caramel. Hitns of fruits. The drinkability is very good as is the body. Wonderful beer here."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Paid $3.19 for a 12oz bottle from Riley's Wines of the World in Madison, WI. Poured into a snifter to review. Not the thickest on the pour. White head of about 1/3\" consistent of relatively small bubbles that dissipates somewhat quickly. Lighter in color than most DIPAs, it takes on a golden orange hue. No retention, but some decent lacing. Nice, well balanced aroma of a lot of malt and even more hops. This has probably the best nose for a balanced IPA I've tried. So perfectly balanced it creates a unique hop profile that is somewhat reminiscent of the 90 Minute IPA. Slightly medicinal in character. Taste is even more balanced than the nose suggested and I instantly am not as impressed as I thought I'd be. Hops seem to have no life in them yet you can tell there are a lot in there. Balanced yet misconstrued. Medium to full body with a long finish and low carbonated mouth. Aftertaste of subdued hop bitterness. Founders makes great malty stouts and that is what they are known for. Even their DIPA was quite malty; I guess that's not what I'm looking for in this style of beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "One of the prettiest beers I have ever poured. Has a cascade like Guinness, a thick head that never leaves and coats the glass as you down it. Color changes from a deep yellow to a lighter gold as the cascade settles itself into the head. The smell is not quite as impressive, mostly hops with a little citrus and grain aroma. Taste is great, rich, slightly bitter, a little sweet honey, and a hint of fruit. Very well balanced hops. Aftertaste is not great but I can deal with it for a beer this good. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, I think the nitro can gives it the creamy feel but it is worth it. A little on the low side of carbonation and gets flat toward the end of the glass. This is one that I have been drinking for years and continually pick up when I find a place that sells the four pack of pint cans. Even better when you can find it on tap."}

Slightly wet, easy on the senses, for that I give it some credit, can't pick out a fault either, and it's enjoyable. Simple. Straightforward. Good. Taste mixes those nose flavors in a nice simple balance. Mild citrus that you can't pinpoint and malt presence in the middle, with a wet orange juice finish.

{"label": 2, "text": "I had the great pleasure of having this at Grey Lodge's Friday the Firkinteenth. A lot of other people must have as well because it kicked in a half hour. This was an incredibly interesting beer. Adding peppercorn to beer is definitely an interesting idea and they pulled it off quite well. Let me go over the negatives first: no discernable smell. The taste more than makes up for it. So while this will affect its overall rating, don't be fooled. I don't care. The overall rating will not reflect the actual overall quality of this beer. The beer didn't have much of a head, but it was pre-poured and crazy inside so I didn't concern myself with that either. Now the positives: It had a beautiful peach color. It tasted wonderful. The peppercorn was not overwhelming but seemed to be sprinkled throughout. It has a nice tingly presence which complemented and didn't overwhelm the other flavors. Of course, it was the flavor and presence you noticed most. Someone mentioned that this was a \"sneaky\" beer. That is very much the case. I was shocked that this was 10.0% abv. Very shocking. I couldn't taste it. And it hides it well. And that is why it gets high marks for drinkability. Brewer's Art is continually impressing me with their beers, which are unique, interesting and high quality. They are to be commended for another great beer."}

Smell: Citrus, caramel, cherry and roasted barley. Smells like a cross between a Barleywine, an IPA and an Imperial Stout. Taste: Taste mostly follows the aroma. Strong citrusy hops balance a caramel, cherry and dark fruit malt backbone. A light roasted character contributes some chocolate and coffee. Fairly bitter finish. Feel: Low carbonation, with a full, boozy, smooth and oily body. Somewhat dry finish. Drinkability: Interesting and fascinating beer that straddles the line between a Barleywine and a Black IPA. Reminds me of Surly Darkness or Goose Island Nightstalker but with the malt center of a Barleywine. Despite its strengths, it is not something I feel a strong desire to return to."}

{"label": 2, "text": "The chilled bomber bottle evidences quite a bit of sediment floating around the bottom, and when cracked open and poured into my Duvel tulip glass the phenomenon intensifies. The detritus appears to be remnants from the dry-hopping process, as quite a bit of the matter in suspension looks a lot like bottom-of-the-bag shake-leaves. The brew itself sparkles a shade of coppery-orange and sports a sturdy cap of glossy, creamy, eggshell-colored foam that sustains itself at two fingers' thickness. Notes of ripe mango, lime leaves, blood oranges, juicy lemons and a smattering of evergreen pine swirl above the glass and grab onto my olfactory receptors as the head slowly settles, the cap of foam resting in a misshapen cloudlike wallop that deposits chunky bands of lacing onto the sides of the glass. The taste is an idyllic take on the perfectly-done West Coast-style IPA, the dry, nearly invisible hint of a malt body yielding to a runaway freight train of hop flavors and and a smack in the mouth of tooth-squeaking, but well-controlled bitterness. Grassy and piney notes pump out the IBUs while mellow hints of ripe orange, lime peel oils and orchardfruits soften the drink and enrich it to savory hoppy perfection. The drink is an easy one to swallow, and is fluffy-medium in body with understated carbonation. Highly drinkable and * almost * as good as the Pliny... Thanks, Murch!"}

T: All of the notes on the nose combine magnificently in the body. The finish is strong chocolate, and the aftertaste is one of the most pronounced, longest aftertastes I've ever had the delight of experiencing. The coffee and roast are restrained so as to not affect the mouthfeel too much. It's built to be a smooth complex beer. Very high quality. The climax is almost overshadowed by the finish, which slightly upsets the balance. Overall, it's divine. Mf: Smooth and wet, and quite thick and filling as well. Perhaps a bit too thick. Dr: It's a late evening conversational sipper, not a summer afternoon beer. I love it and would definitely seek it out. The price was fair in Rome (6 euro per pint) for how high quality this brew is."}

{"label": 0, "text": "12oz. bottle served into a pint glass Pours a murky taxicab yellow. Not so much cloudy as slightly hazy. One finger of white head forms, reducing to a thin ring. Very respectable lacing elevates this beer to above average in appearance. The lemon is immediately noticeable. Not just that lemony zip of wheat that is present in basically all American Pale Wheat Ales but specficially a sugary lemon candy sort of smell. The label mentions that this beer was brewed with the zest of Eureka and Lisbon lemons from California. What you get as a result is a heavy smell of Lemonheads brand candy. No yeast aromas to speak of (which is good if rating to the APWA style). Ghosts of spice, but I think that's just a mental trick. A tiny bit of hops; could use more. I like the lemons when cold, but they get to be too artificial after a while. As the beer warms it increasingly takes on the aroma of air freshener. Oh, no. No. This taste is disastrous. Artificial, chemically lemon taste. Soapy phenols at the sides of the tongue. Not really much wheat flavor. Stronger is the flavor of potato bread that hasn't been fully baked. The finish is a discordant nightmare. It is really unpleasant. Mouthfeel is pretty average for the style. It has enough carbonation and body. If it tasted worth a shit then it would be more drinkable than it is. Avoid at all costs. Coastal Wheat has all the makings of a solid beer... except for how it tastes. An unfortunate misstep."}

But it was soon consumed by the thin dark brown beer. When I held it to light, it had a strange likening to a glass of cold coffee with the same colored red amber glow around the bowl of the bottom of the glass. The smell was unimpressive, like a sweet roasted soy sauce. The first taste that hit me was a nutty coffee flavor. I noticed a slight smokiness of the beer in the after-swallow. On the second taste, I noticed a strong sweet citrus flavor. After the beer was finished, I was left with the taste of smoked celery. The beer felt thin in the mouth, but it was a smooth welcomed lightness. It is a good dark beer to drink on a hot day."}

Kind of a sharp champagne taste that sucks the moisture from your mouth, nothing that vaguely reminds me of a hefe. The feel is watery and dry.

First taste, Spice, floral, too much up front,....like a first date gone bad....I looked forward to the first impression so much that the impression left something to be desired. This was my first Pumpkin Beer so I had to have my reserves, and I didnt want to hit the style in the negative. First off the smell was amazing. The appearance was great, the head and lacing was pretty solid, the smell was out of this world,...last was the taste,....for me drain poor. Sweet, nice spice, great abundance of smell and appearance, but taste was so off I couldnt finish. I wanted to so much because I read about the style so much. I would say that the taste of the style was on, but the for the style I would say that the spice kicked it WAY too much and turned me off the pumkin beers, I would never try again unless someone told me that the taste wasnt so harsh. I would say that for the style this was close, but for me I couldnt stand to finish it....if that makes sense. If you like the pumkin beers try it, but for me, I coulldnt last."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I used to just think that no beer looked bad if it had Ralph Steadman artwork on the bottle. This is true, but it goes beyond that, so far as Flying Dog is concerned. The brewery has always done a great job in presenting a bottle that doesn't just cool but also projects the feel of the beer inside. Heller Hound's bottle is that of a clear sky, blueness, and the only things that are jagged are the drunkards standing underneath it. That's what spring feels like, when you're standing in it and drunk. And that's what a good bock should make you feel like. HH isn't the only example of this, but it's the easiest to describe. There's also Gonzo Imperial Porter, the skull-faced representation of the recently deceased Hunter Thompson coming off as vulgar but not at all creepy or mournful, dark and deep but still celebratory, not ponderous. In Heat Wheat shows a lightly golden, mild summer sky, pastoral except for the jagged bitch in heat in its center, attracting the tail end of a dozen suitors. It's peaceful and tame, but also drunk and raucous. Double Dog Ale is no exception to this fine tradition. Its label is entirely brown and orange except for a few small spots but it does not come off at all as unbalanced or harsh. It is bunch of shades mixed together that are very hard to mix together successfully, and its mascot, a bediapered dog with a foot-wide tongue and a knowing grin, signals the same sense of wonderful, incomprehensible inebriation that a nightful of double IPAs is sure to result in. The beer is a perfectly balanced mess of stinging west coast hops, citrusy, piney, dry, and dripping with nectar. Then there's the fresh, sweet biscuity and roasted nutty malt that's given a dryer backbone by a wonderful string of chewy yeast. It all tastes and smells strange and strong, like its cover, but it's strange and strong in the best of kind of way. Balanced to perfection, leading to nothing but joy. Another winner from the most unfairly maligned brewer in the country."}

Orange rind also noticeable, but faint. Leafy hop presence, but not much there--more of a toasted malt and barley essence. Bitter and dry finish. D: Not sure I'd get this again. Not a blonde in my opinion."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a deep, hazy golden hue with a nice off-white mousse that shows moderate retention and leaves some rings of stick behind on the glass. Aroma is citrusy, with orange and orange peel, lemon zest, and a bit of wheatiness intermingling with a light fragrance of cranberries. Body and mouthfeel are pleasant, with a spritely effervescence provided by a moderate level of carbonation lifting what would otherwise be a slick and moderately thick, protein-rich brew. Malted barley and wheat both play a nice, pleasant, none-too-sweet base for the spicy notes of coriander and cinnamon and fruity, citrusy orange, with a barely discernible smooth, lightly tart cranberry flavor that comes in just toward the back just before the light, citrusy finish. Very well-rounded, the cranberry plays a supporting rather than a dominating role and never dominates. While I am (unlike most) a fan of Boston Beer's Cranberry Lambic, this brew would make a superb replacement for that brew and would certainly garner much greater praise for its level of balance and a name that garners no false pretenses (as in Cranberry \"Lambic\"). Superbly drinkable, I was left craving another. The Longshot pack contains two bottles; sadly, my girlfriend had already downed the other. Certainly one I hope becomes available in the holiday sampler, and perhaps a viable reality considering creator Carissa Sweigart's status as a BBC employee."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A 12 oz bottle purchased at one of PA's best beer destinations. A: The ale is a deep dark brown color, almost black. The head is not very big on pour but does leave hints of lace throughout the glass. S: The aroma is wheaty with a distinct smoky profile. Underlying that smoke (which may be a product of the esters) is a banana clove weizen scent, absolutely delicious. T: The weizenbock does not pull any punches. The ale is loaded with esters that give a pleasing banana-clove flavor. Those esters are paired nicely with dark, chocolatey coffee malts. The slightly roasted malt pairing with fruity esters is an excellent match, delicious without ratcheting up the alcohol. M: Chocolate and bananas, what's there not to like? This beer has earned its well-deserved place on this site. D: The 9.50% is completely unfathomable. There is no hint of that level of alcohol anywhere in the ale. The flavors are sweet and burnt, in perfect balance together."}

Like drinking a not so good rood beer soda that you know is beer and has some beerish overtones. I understand the idea of following old recipies, and I like the idea of a root beer beer, but perhaps this could have been reworked a bit before release. Tone down the spice and everything would be more nice."}

Just ok for me. M - medium bodied, little dry D - Not my favorite winter brew. The balance of hops and malt was not meshing well with my tastebuds.

At the initial taste it has a bit of caramel taste to it, but much less then the standard Dead Guy Ale. The whiskey flavor is much less then you would hope for. This was an easy to drink beer, but nothing all that special... like I said, going after Curieux is a tough job. give this one a 3.5"}
{"label": 1, "text": "On the palate it isn't powerful and moving, but it does give a somewhat smooth, sweet, and deep flavor. And overall, that is enough for me to enjoy it.

This is a real \"Oak Aged\" beer, or at least one that allows the oak to shine! I very much so enjoyed this beer.

I may try this beer again."}

The taste is a combination of sweet and tart cherries. More tart than sweet, which is as it should be. Not a complex fruit beer, but a solid one. Light to medium bodied, Low carbonation, with a sweet aftertaste. Nothing about this beer stands out as extraordinary, but it is solid, and worth trying. Nice for the summer months."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Hazy orange amber body, topped by two fingers of slighty off-white level foam. Dense lacing. Incredibly slight hay aroma. This is a foam in the nose sniffer. A quick flash of malty sweetness, a speeding bullet of fruit, and it all vanishes in a quick swallow. No finish, no aftertaste. Light, airy, almost fizzy mouthfeel. Drinkability is unimpaired and uninspired. The beer to give to Bud drinkers when the BAs have Hopsickle."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A prestigiously looking red paper-wrapped bottle of Embrasse matured on oak barrels used to contain whiskey. Pours hazed reddish dark brown body overlayered by dense tan head with good retention and stickage. This is an excellent example of aging on peated whiskey casks: aroma of dried cherries and raisins interplays with that of a chocolaty-bredy malt and you are blown away by wisely judged amount of strongly peated whisky. The flavor correspond to the nose and although the soft carobonated body is creamy, finish remains dry. Simmilar and distinguished from its older brother (Embbrasse) by strong peat notes."}

I an a favorite of the Belgium Whites, so I knew this would be worth trying. Again the beer was not only complemented by me but as well as a buddy of mine who is rather picky on his brews. The Taste is amazing with a little hint of cinnamon in the mouth. This is an absolute beer you must try, I have nothing bad to say about it."}

Very nice. T- Fantastic beer. Just like the nose, heavy on the bourbon, vanilla and maple with lots of complex derivative of those flavors as they blend together with the brown sugars, a little bit of cherries and dark fruits and a touch of oak. A very interesting beer that is supremely complex. M- Low carbonation that works well with the style. D- A fantastic beer, I have one more in my cellar that I will be saving and I might be inclined to go trade for more."}

The hops give a nice bitterness with orange and tropical fruit flavors."}

It is clean in the flavor and well balanced. I like this beer. I recommend this as a good example for reds."}

Minimal large bubbly white head quickly dissipating to little to no foam at all.. left looking a touch watery.. which really is kind of expected from the style.. though it's still Rogues Pacman yeast which is used in just about everything of theirs. - Lovely wheat and malt nose, citrus and grassy hop flare, some lemon zest, herbal touch, light alcohol or almost a citrusy cocktail scent. Very good smell. - Tasty clean wheat and malt backbone, slightly bready, citrus flare with a grassy herbal hop quality. Certainly smooth and balanced in flavor. I wish I could get a 6-pack ofr this for about $5. - Medium to light bodied, well carbonated and bubbly. Slightly drying. Parches the palate a touch. - Overall this is expected from such a stellar brewery. A very good wheat brew with fantastic flavors. I would recommend at least trying it, and you can later make up your mind if you want to pay the price to ever buy more."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Wow from start to finish. The packaging is so nice I hate to open the bottle. It pours a deep brown color that shines garnet in the light. The head is light brown and leaves a little lacing. Tha aroma is all chocolate malt and then yeast. The flavor is definitely cocoa, but the roasted malts are not forgotten. The mouthfeel is silky and lingers with the flavor of chocolate (duh). This beer goes down really easy, the 750ml. bottle suddenly doesn't seem big enough."}

Its not very dark, more like an average coffee than a nice dark porter stout, although it does have wonderful head and lacing. It has a fantastic aroma and taste, though! Excellent scents/flavors of chocolate and roasted barley, but the best part is how it smells and tastes almost like a smoked porter. Goes down well and would make a great digestif. Very much worth a try!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Thanks to Jim at Sherbrooke and Steve from Paddock Wood for the sample! This beer was brewed to show support for Saskatoon's The Ultimate Power Duo getting invited to perform at the Olympics in Vancouver Feb. 17-19. You know you've made it as a band when you get to play such a high profile event AND get a beer brewed for you as well in the same year, let alone a few month's time. Comes in a 341 ml brown bottle. Pours out a cloudy orange/light amber, like a marmalade. Tall loose creamy off-white head that slowly settles to a thin frothy cap. Sweet creamy smooth aroma, biscuity malt, faint toasted notes, orange citrus, floral and grassy hops. Faint butterscotch diacetyl, but it doesn't detract. Impressive balance in the flavour, the hops almost immediately kick in, but the malt backbone is strong enough to keep it in balance. Rich bready malt up front is immediately joined by citrus and floral hops, pine resin picks up in the middle, herbal and earthy on the finish, although in the aftertaste it sweetens up again with bready, biscuity malt and floral, orange notes. Low-lying character of grapefruit rind pith. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, low carbonation, smooth and creamy for the most part, some thin spots. Probably the smoothest and most approachable of the Canadian DIPA's I've yet to sample, ringing in at 80 IBU's it is balanced, with an equal presence of malt and a fairly refined hop bill. Definitely not a runaway train of hop madness, this DIPA is civilized."}
{"label": 1, "text": "1 L swing-top bottle purchased at the brewery...Great label! Appearance: Deep brown, stout-like. Good caramel-colored head with some serious strength. Smell: I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised that the smoke aroma didn't overtake it. The smoke is definitely there, but more as a background. Nice roasted malt and chocolate-like aromas predominate. The smoke background is a woody-like aroma. Taste: I was again happily surprised that the smoke wasn't the only thing there. Initially, it seemed like I was tasting a bit of East End's Black Strap Stout, minus the sweetness. There is a strong roasty and cocoa flavor with a mild hop astringency. Woody smoke flavors lay in the background never trying to dominate things. A great overall balance. Mouthfeel: Nice body and carbonation feel good in the mouth and on the tounge. Drinkability: I really like it, but I can see this being over the top for some. Mostly smooth and balanced for a porter."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This was presented to me with about a finger's worth of solid, bone-white head with decent retention. The coriander was evident on the nose. The color was a cloudy lemon-yellow.

{"label": 1, "text": "From a 750 ml bottle with the distinctive thistle logo, this is a typical strong euro-beer. It's a pale copper color with a simple white head. Boozy, malty aroma. Wood and whiskey are predominant, followed by a little sulfur. Not a great beer nose. The taste is sweet and a little hot and peppery. It's a strong beer, but quiet on substance. Full in body, with decent carbonation and lots of heft. This brew was a bit of a let-down."}

It imitates the look of your average amber ale, but the smell is a different story. This has a great citrus and pine note to it. I am instantly reminded of simcoe hops, which seems to be the dominant scent in this brew. Agitation of the beer summons more great whiffs. This is truly a good smelling ale. Taste is very similar to the smell, heavy on this citrus and pine flavors. Very appealing. Feels good in the mouth, slightly slick, oily and very easy to drink. Excellent all around brew. Wish I could have another."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Gold, leaning slightly to copper. My sample had no head while the other three beers had heads. The aroma is pretty weak, but thats not surprising with a lager.

I would prefer a beer with a bit more body, but if I were just out drinking, I wouldnt complain about drinking this."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Very nice amber appearance with a big fluffy beige head that contained large cola-like bubbles. The smell was somewhat mild in hops but pineapple cake was present which I appreciated. Taste was very watery, bitter from hops but not enough bubbles to complement the style. No fruit really noticed in the taste aside from mandarin orange in light sugar syrup. Drinkability was reduced do to a watery feel and lack of flavor."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The bottle is very professional looking. nice and sleek, the bottle's graphics has changed since the picture on this site. Very appealing just as the bottle. Once poured, it's even more amazing. The first thought is \"this is a light beer??\" as it looks like a regular Sam Adams w/ a dark color, copper and carbonated w/ a nice head that fades quickly, mild lacing. Smell is average, I'm actually not picking up a lot from it. Taste is not as much as I had hoped, maybe the appearance got me excited. I am picking up some corn type of flavors. Maybe a slight sweetness in there as well. Mouthfeel is nothing special, some carbonation, thats it. It's ok, one of the better light beers, but still not great. I would bring this to a get together of non-appreciative beer drinkers, those that wouldn't appeal to some of the better beers out there."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Nice creamy off white cap atop a dark brown body that appears light brown when held towards a light source. Nutty aroma, toasted brown bread and a metallic note. Same metallic taste noted in the taste with light brown sugar, dark toasty malt and pralines. Mouthfeel is a bit thinand the body isn't as full as others in it's class. A good example of an English brown."}
{"label": 1, "text": "We had this at New Year's, so our season was appropriate for celebration. And after a few of these, the celebration was well-lubricated. It pours dark amber, a nice shade for the dark winter months. The smell, well, very hoppy and citrus-y. Prepares you well for what's about to happen to your body. The taste is an onslought of hops, and it fills your entire mouth and nose with the flavor. The hops aren't quite as flavorful as other great IPAs, but you do get the nice flowery scent and wonderfully bitter flavor that will warm you quite nicely. Tough for a session beer because it's such a heavy and powerful taste. But, luckily, a session with SN Celebration isn't a long one, with its relatively large ABV"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Picked up a single from WF Bowery beer room. Love that Founders is now available in NY. A- Pours a brassy peachy yellow. Kind of reminds me of a yellowish white zin. Has a bright white fine cap on it. The beer I slightly hazy. S- Slight sweetness, grainy, a tart blip at the end. Not really exciting though. T- the taste is way more flavorful than the nose. I get sweet cherries with very subtle tartness. Reminds me of cherry pie filling at a 4th of July picnic, on a good way. There seems to be a touch of cinnamon in there too. This does not taste like a beer, or a \"sour\" either, but it is a tasty treat. Glad I bought a pint of vanilla ice cream to go with it too! M- light to medium with a slight viscosity to it, just shy of feelin cloying. Almost no carbonation noted. D- definitely a dessert like treat. Kind of excited to try it with the ice cream. This will be my first non-stout beer float. I like the access to a cherry beer that is not some high priced cuvee."}

Tastes of the grassy hops with some light malt sweetness. Hops lead off with grass and lemon notes along with floral qualities. Malts add in with some light grainy sweetness and a bit of bread. Bitterness takes the edge when compared to the sweetness. Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation. Overall, this is above average, but the price ($7.00) doesn't really warrant a pickup unless you are really curious."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Appearance - Foggy yellow, with decent head formation, nothing great. Apparently its unfiltered, hence the fogginess. Smell - Very sweet wheat flavor, with hints of honey, delicious. Taste - Opposite of the smell, altough slightly sweet, it's too malty for my like, and comparative to the cheap malt brews. I would agree with the previous reviewers that this is one of the worse SA brews. Drinkability - Not really drinkable, because I don't find it particularly appealing."}
{"label": 2, "text": "16.9 oz heavy brown bottle with clear freshness dating. Poured in my SA pint glass, the beer is a amber with a dense , long lasting, chiffon like brown head. The beer has an aroma of light grains and toasted crackers. The taste is of mildly roasted grains backed by honey. The beer is slightly sweet and has a bit of earthiness. After about a three sips a bit of plum emerges. Dry slightly chalky finish. The mouth is very smooth and a touch oily. Very easy beer to drink, would be easy to session or to pair with non-spicy food. Surprisingly decent and my favorite Bulgarian beer to date. I see they have been making it since 1881, well I think they have doing something right as the beer is surprisingly decent. Well woth the $1.29 I paid at Famous Liquors in Lombard, IL."}
{"label": 2, "text": "12oz bottle $1.85 bottled 04/24/09. Nice golden yellow color, little head, clear. I was expecting this to be like a Belgian Titan IPA but it is not. It smells slightly hoppy and a whiff of Belgian style yeast. The flavor is interesting, not as hoppy as it smells but the normal IPA flavors are not completely overwhelmed as they are in some other American-Belgian-style_IPA's (whew). This is still recognizable as an IPA in my opinion with a bitter finish."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Presentation: It was poured from a brown 24oz bottle into a pint glass. The label reads 2nd release 2009. Appearance: The pour produced a tall thick and pillowy foam head. It is light tan in color and has great retention. It keeps a nice one finger thick cap all the way down the glass and as I drink, it leaves behind nice lacing on the glass. Under this head is a deep rich amber colored liquid. The beer is not totally clear as I noticed that there is a very fine yeast particle haze in it. Smell: The aroma has a citrus like hop character with some pine notes as well. Under that are some light bready/malty notes with just a hint of raw grain and even some fruity/estery/yeasty notes. Taste/Palate: The flavor has a sturdy base of bready malty sweetness with a touch of raw grain. Hop flavor is the focus here though, and they add an assertive yet well balanced bitterness and solid citrus (lemon and orange rind and pith) sweet spicy herbal and mild pine like flavor notes. The finish has a long slow bitter hop fade. Its palate has a nice lively feel with plenty of soft carbonation and a good solid medium body. Notes: This beer is absolutely outstanding. I really enjoyed the play between malt sweetness and the solid hop bitterness."}

They weren't overpowering but strong enough. If I had to take a guess I would say that they were Hallertauer. TASTE: The taste was exactly like the smell. Everything blended very well MOUTHFEEL: It was light and smooth. The carbonation was light but had enough to let you know it was there. Rolled over the tounge nicely to show you the flavors.

It does...towards the end a nice, rich floral hop aroma comes out, bringing some sweet malts with it. The aroma is very light spicey hops, with a touch of piney aroma and light malt underneath. The taste is luckily not as elusive...spicey, piney hops up front...definitly not over powering compared to the toasty, nutty malt underbelly. There seems to be a hop complexity that isn't present in other double ipa's which makes it seem even better. This is definitely a nice, spicey beer for the hop head in all of us."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Sampled on 6-21-10 Pours a hazy golden brown color with a pleasant white head that settles to a thin layer. Smell is nicely malty, not over thick or sweet, with a light floral hops at the very end. Surprisingly delicate. Taste is a bit sweet and adjunct, bland and boring. Not offensive, just nothing going on. Mouthfeel is decent, creamy but a little on the flat side. Drinkability suffers from the lack of anything memorable in the flavor. Overall, totally worth it if you can get one for free."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Upon pour you'll find a merky golden-pear coloured body with bubbly two-finder head. The head quickly dissipates however, with little to no lacing. Sour apple comes through on the nose first and foremost, like a freight-train on open road. The taste is cider-like, very thin with plenty of carbonation. Bitter, sour apple and berry are the definitive flavours, with a hint of damp cinamon and hops in the background. It's actually really not something that I'm enjoying, despite how passable or even interesting the above description may sound. The brew lacks depth and complexity, and in all honesty I'd rather be drinking a vodka apple cider, but if you're a fan of framboise you may well get to like this one."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a pitch black with a great caramel colored head that goes nowhere fast. Good lacing. Smell is fantastic. Lots of oak and vanilla character, sweet malts, maybe some bourbon, cream. Taste is very sweet, oaky, vanilla notes, not much roastiness in there but lots of malty sweetness. I tend to like my Impy stouts more bold but this is still very pleasant. Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. Not too much carbonation, slick. Fairly drinkable."}

Aftertaste is light and fairly bitter. I wish the taste were a little stronger and long-lasting. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of prickly carbonation. Drinkability: Good drinkability. You could drink a couple pints on a cold evening. Overall: Good beer overall. Another fine offering from Samuel Smith. The only thing holding this one back is that the flavor seems to fade too quickly. Definitely worth a shot."}

A little bit burnt, but not enough to take away from the sweetness. Just a little bit of hops come through. T&M - There are a lot of sharp flavors. I have another one of these aging, but I probably should have left this one to mellow as well. I taste those standard SN hops, but the alcohol is really up front, the carbonation is seemingly strong for the style, and the strong syrup sweetness doesn't know what to do with itself in the mix. One thing is for sure - I haven't had anything like it, and that is good. D - I am sharing the 24 oz bottle, but sharing a 12 oz would have been better. I just don't want that much."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Off tap at the Map Room in Chicago. The beer came to me a rubied brown color with a small head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was sweet grapefruity hop, with a caramel and roasted malt behind the hop. The flavor was as expected from SN. A nice hop and roasted maltiness with some brown sugar sweetness. I liked it, but its pretty hoppy for a brown ale. The feel was moderate to thick with a very healthy carb to keep it from being syrupy or too thick. In the end, the hop dominated the qualities I associate with a brown ale. I would liked to see a little more balance in the force. This was a pretty good beer, but not a fantastic brown ale."}

Smell consisted of hops, malts, and some pine aromas? It was something along those lines but it did seem strange. Taste was hoppy and citrusy, almost like a grapefruit-like bitterness to it. Lots of carbonation in this brew and it makes it good. A good pils should have a decent amount of carbonation. This would make a great session beer. I really like the bitterness in this one, it's not over the top, but it restates what the taste is like. A fine brew."}

{"label": 1, "text": "2. Sam Adams \"Cherry Wheat\" *Bottled beer poured into a Sam Adams \"Boston Lager\" Pint Glass. Appearance- Pours a light golden color into the glass, and the carbonation quickly coalsesces into an inch and a half head. Great retention. There is some visible carbonation and the beer leaves a thick, bubbly lace on the glass. Smell- The beer gives off a rich, fruity smell that almost overwhelms the more- subtle scents of bread. Taste- This drink gives off heavy tones of malt and bread. The taste of hops and cherry balance quite nicely giving the beer a taste that is not overwhelmed by the fruit. Mouth Feel- Decent carbonation that tickles the tongue as you move the beer around your mouth. Crisp, with a light to medium body. Makes for a smooth Drinkability- This beer is a good drink on a cold fall day. It is an entertaining experience from the moment the thick head rises over your glass to the to the moment that the cherry and bread flavors mix on your palate. My only problem with this beer is that the taste quickly becomes confusing to the point where I cannot tell the different between the cherry, malt or hops. That being said, each sip ends with a light, crispness that does not ebb as you continue to drink."}
{"label": 2, "text": "12 Oz Bottle. Crispy bready rich hop aroma of citrus oils, creamy fragrant pine and volatile florals. A great concoction of hoppiness. Lightly hazed pour of orange-amber, with a deluxe silky soap of banana-tinted cream. Sticky sheets of lacing. Flavor is a warming sweet glow of banana skin, lime peel, candied figs and pear nectar. Its along the lines of the hop-heavy aroma, but melds nicely with the malt character and isnt destructively bitter. The hop flavors were well built here and in combination with the malt, make a luscious light fruitness. Finishes a tough sticky sweet, but a mouthful of hop cones help dry it out. For 10.5% alcohol its extremely adept at concealing it! A very nice beer. Thanks Josh!"}

A= looks like any other adjunct lager. Fizzy yellow but there is a little retention on it. S= nothin impressive here if you have smelled beer you have smelled old style I bumped it up because the beer smell was a little stronger than bud. T= not half bad. A guy next to me was trying to coax his wife into trying it because it wasn't \"that\" bad. I liked it. A little extra flavor in it mixed with delicious adjunct. M= same as any adjunct lager. Crisp and refreshing at Wrigley. D= great. Super fine beer to have at the ball game. Not even trying to bash bud but this had more flavor and was still a great ballgame beer"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights and a creamy tan head that holds OK. The aroma is clearly fruity, and even wine-like, but offers only a slight chocolatey maltiness to those who seek it out. The body is medium with a fine carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor offers fruitiness up front and then reveals some caramel and mild chocolate before fading away in a finish that expresses only a minor note of lingering chocolate. The hop bitterness is quite restrained and just balances the thin maltiness. Overall a very mild and basic cross-over beer that might make a nice change at summer outings or with groups of people who aren't accustomed to stronger flavored beers."}

The mouthfeel was medium in body, moderately carbonated, and somewhat drying. A very drinkable beer."}

S - Mainly floral and citrus hops, along with a strange briny character. Different, but pleasing. T - Floral and citrus hit upfront with a touch of sweet malt. Briny character is evident mid palate along with faint malt. Mid to late-palate an intense bitterness kicks in which lasts through a long finish. M - Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation. Carbonation should've been higher considering the insane bitterness. D - I would definitely not have more than one of these; in fact I am questioning whether or not I'll get through this glass. Very unbalanced, and the bitterness gets in the way a lot. Otherwise the flavor is great, and I probably would love it if not for the unnecessary bitternes."}

A bit underwhelming and bland for a Cantillon. m - Light body and low carbonation, smooth and easy to drink. d - While I enjoyed this quite a bit and it is certainly not a bad beer at all, this is one of the lesser Cantillon's I've had. It's drinkable and has a great nose but the taste it s bit lacking and no where near as good as some as their other beers. Would have again but not for the price."}

Taste follows suit, steady malt with a smooth bitter and undertones of the promised cinnamon and je ne sais quoi (they tell me it's orange). Sweet on the tip of the tongue and tart near the throat, it stays thick and flavorful in my mouth without annoying me with a cloying stickiness. Flavorful and intriguing."}

Dark brown/near-black solid body that doesn't get any lighter at the fringes. S - Roasty, milk chocolate, some sugar and buttery notes, as well as some dark fruits. Quite sweet and fairly English in character. T - Taste is also heavy on milk chocolate, nuts, dark fruits, and light coffee bitterness in the finish. M - Zesty moderate carbonation, medium body, and somewhat dry finish. Alcohol isn't apparent at all. D - A very enjoyable porter that is more English than American thanks to the fruity yeast. It was easy to put down my 4oz and I'd gladly take a six-pack of this for an after-dinner beer."}

Yields a finger of light tan head that fades to a thin film over the top of the beer. Minimal lacing on the glass. S - Big and malty! Lots of caramel and milk chocolate up front. Hints of coffee, raisin and molasses intermingle as well. T - Strong dark chocolate, raisins and black currants. A bitterness hits toward the middle that is not entirely hop-like. It's almost more of a black coffee-like bitterness. I also get some vanilla and caramel as it warms. The malt body of this beer wasn't quite as sweet or potent as I was hoping it would be judging by the smell. M - Medium body. Has a slightly dry finish, but the malt sticks around well after, leaving the mouth sticky. Overall, not a bad brew. I think it just didn't quite live up to it's potential. I think it could be better by lowering the attenuation (i.e. lowering the alcohol, but increasing the sugars left in the beer)."}

No bubbles to be seen in the glass. Aroma is sweet with notes of honey and pitted fruits. Apricots, even? Beer is quite sweet. A little nut flavor, but not much. Honey and sweet apricot. Some fig flavor as well. There is an unexpected and short-lived bitter finish which seems to be due mainly to burnt malt. It actually works. A bit of drying parch on the tongue and alcohol warming in the belly. Unexpectedly flavorful, the only ding against the drinkability of this beer is its close to cloying sweetness."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Chocolate Bock A: Deep Brown with ruby tinges in good lightning. Pours a magnificent fluffy head that fades into a fine light brown lacing. S: The aroma was not as expected - I detected citrus rind, nutmeg, spices underlying a natural roasted malt character. There is a subtle (polar bear in a snowstorm subtle) hint of cocoa, but it is far from the dominant feature. T: Did I just bite into a giant, carbonated Chocolate Bar? One of the reasons I love beer is how little aroma can correlate to actual taste; sometimes it can, sometimes it does no such thing. If the aroma was a short trip up the sugar and spice train, the taste was the Midnight Chocolate Express (Have you ever been to a Turkish Prison?) The initial taste was strongly chocolate and a cascade of roasted malts; as your palate adjusts, you take in a hazlenut feel that gives it the sense of a carbonated jar of nutella; finally, after half a bottle, you're wondering if the sweet finish is beginning to taste a bit like chocolate cough syrup. A drinkable and sweet beer, this makes an good evening dessert beer. It's almost too sweet to drink in any quantity, and I imagine after several of these you might lapse into a sugar coma."}
{"label": 2, "text": "341ml bottle poured in a pint glass. Straw yellow and cloudy. Big white head is about 2 inches high on the pour, almost overtopping the glass. Head settles down to a solid 1/8 inch cap. Intricate lacing down the sides. Aroma is dominated by that distinct Unibroue belgian yeast scent. Spices and cloves accent the background. The same yeast flavour that is Unibroue's signature is omnipresent throughout. Accompanying the yeast is a subtle wheat flavour. Light spiciness and hints of cloves appear in the middle to finish. A little tartness pokes through in the middle as well. Aftertaste of yeast and wheat. Light-Medium bodied with a big rush of pinpricks of carbonation. This is one Unibroue offering that I would consider buying again. Although all of their products are in the good to great range, I'm just not a big fan of the styles. This beer is refreshing, light and pleasing. The first time I had it a few months ago, it was terrific with a chicken dish my sister made. In fact, it's the best beer I've found thus far to pair with chicken."}

S - Pretty mild on the hop front, with caramel and toffee, touch of citrus and some spiciness is also coming through. T - Earthy hops that come across quite mild on the tongue, with the caramel and toffee malts coming through on the finish. An oily resin lingers on the palette. The ABV is very well hidden. M - Lighter bodied ale that can come across a tad syropy. A carbonation lift might be useful here. O - Overall a tasty DIPA, but not my favourite. Certainly more balanced, offering up fewer hops than I would've otherwise liked. Worth picking up, but if you`re expecting a hop bomb you'll be disappointed."}

Good bitterness in the mouth, that lingers after you swallow. Very good carbonation that tingles the tongue, but doesn't get in the way. No smell of note, but the malt is definately there in the flavor. This beer is very drinkable, being much lighter in texture than you would expect from the look."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12 ounce bottle into a pint glass A - A strong pour delivers a bountiful head that rises to about a finger and a half thick and off white in appearance. The retention seems pretty good. Trace amounts of carbonation are rising to the top. The color is light than I was expecting for a bock, more of brown and quite clear when held up to the light. S - Caramel, roasted malts along with some spice notes and hops hit the nose. Overall, not quite as strong as I was expecting. T - Caramel and malts are definitely present. There is a nice combination of hops and spice notes. Again, like the nose, not as full bodied as I would have wanted but nothing terrible. M - Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Into the mouth, the palate tastes caramel and roasted malts. Then comes a subtle blast of carbonation that cleans the palate for the spice notes and slight hoppy finish. A pretty smooth finish overall. D - Like the Creamy Stout, this beer appeals to a larger crowd, and it seems to fit the bill. Personally, when I have a bock, I want something full bodied and heavy, especially during the winter. I understand what Sam Adams is putting out but this beer seems more like a fall/spring beer, not a winter beer or maybe even a bock for that matter."}

On with the review. Pours a perfect pitch black, couple fingers of tan/mocha head. Fantastic retention, and excellent lace. Nose is the epitome of roastiness, dark chocolate and espresso. Huge coffee notes, and I'm sensing a bit of the alkeehawl in the background. Taste follows to a degree, blast of the rich roastiness is the initial impression. More espresso than you can imagine here, the coffee is almost overpowering; I almost get a sense of some cream or milkiness, can't tell if I'm fabricating this because of the mouthfeel or if this flavour is actually present. Regardless, alcohol isn't hidden by any stretch, well known as this hits the back of my throat. Definite creaminess and fullness in the mouth, slick as can be and just coats every part of my mouth, but finishes dry and bitter (coffee bitterness). Thick, fat and sludgy perfection. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit, chances are I couldn't sit down for more than a couple of these but that more a function of the ABV than the beer itself. Exceptional stuff."}

Being ten percent i thought the alcohol would assert itself more but it doesn't, instead the gentle malt flavors held my attention. A dry finish was near perfect ending, now i'm beginning to feel the ten percent."}

It was a very luxurious smoke that I could sit with infront of the fire for hours on end. The flavors came along pretty much the same way with a medium amount of hoppiness in the mid sip. This only lasted into the finish and any biterness was gone pretty quickly. I love everything that this brewery makes and this beer only gives us beer nuts an opportunity to try something a bit higher in alcohol(even though I did'nt think that it tasted much like it had 8% in it. I would say it felt more like 6%). A must try for smoke Aficianado's."}

S - Personally, I thought it was a mildly, nutmeg/clove spiced aroma, strong notes of pumpkin, with a hint of \"roasted-ness\" up front. However, in the back, the tase became breadier. I like the idea of fresh baked cookies, but this might be a stretch."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Appearance: Deep copper in color with some dark orange in the shading as well; poured a solid 2 finger head that was a bit rocky and off-white; head had decent retention and eventually faded to a thick skim with heavier spots that look chewy; sticky/oily foamy residue clings to the sides of the glass as the head disappears; oily residue on the swirl clings as well. Beer is very clear with no sediment or cloudiness whatsoever. Smell: Wonderfully bitter right up front - nice and citrus (grapefruit) with hints of pine; a firm sweet malty backing is there as well and there's a certain sweetness that's a little honey-esque as well. I'm especially excited about the upfront bitterness here. Taste: Outstanding. Bitter again right up front from a great hop presence, a little more piney than I thought it would have been, but the citrus flavor is still the most dominant. There is a very mild sweetness buried in there as well, but it's very subdued and allows the bitterness to be very much upfront. I would place the taste in the realm of Founders Double Trouble due to the bitterness as opposed to the sweetness of a Hopslam. Mouthfeel: A nice body, not thin at all -- nice and full; a nice sticky coating is left behind from the hop oils and great malt backing; once the beer gets down the throat, I find that the palate begins to dry very warmly and a nice tingling is present from the higher ABV. Very nice and it's exactly what I would expect from a DIPA. Drinkability: Moderate, but not too high. While it's a great drink and very enjoyable, the ABV is pretty high and I couldn't take more than one, possibly two in a night -- I think if I went that direction I'd be pretty well intoxicated so I'd stick with just one at the end of the night."}

Aroma- VERY strong chocolate aroma with tons of roasted malts. Can sense this is going to be a very strong stout but Spruce?!?! Nothing to do with the season or any type of pumpkin beer so far.

While the flavor of the beer was exceptional, the bottle had no carbonation, apparantly due to some \"problem in the bottling line.\" No problem with this bottle. Amazing stuff. Gorgeous raw honey appearance, with a very eager and active head that looks like a fine meringue. The lacing looks like sea foam. The scents of hops, lemon peel, malt, pine, the ocean, and fresh grapefruit leap from the glass. One of the most aromatic IPA's this nose has ever smelled. Starts with hints of pecan pie, followed by plenty of bitter hops, with a serious grapefruit zest finish. Incredible balance for a beer with this much flavor. Lovely and lively in the mouth. Lots of carbonation this time(!) balanced by a rich creaminess. Undoubtably one of the easiest drinking big beers I've ever tasted. (Frankly, one of the BEST beers I've ever tasted.) Bravo!"}

This beer is a pleasure to smell. A rich, malty rush of brown sugar sweetness presents strong toffee aromas. A touch of alcohol tingles the nose before blending in to a light smokiness. A hint of raisins add additional closing sweetness. A rich spice flavor starts the beer and gains strength in a hurry. A huge malt rush soon follows with a rich, candied yam flavor. Strong, yet balanced, smoke flavors add delicious complexity holding the sugary flavors in check. Seemingly forever after taking a sip, a light alcohol burn hits the tongue followed by a rich caramel taste that closes in from unsuspected. Unlike many barrel aged brews, this one does a wonderful job of imparting all the right flavors. The mouthfeel is lightly spiced, barely carbonated but a bit on the syrupy side. Fortunately, it is not out of bounds for the style. The overall finish is quite dry. Drinkability is very good. This is delightful to sip and dangerously drinkable at the same time."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Draft at Delaney's. Golden colour with some white head, leaving abundant lace. The carbonation is right there. Sourness in the finish detracts from the enjoyment.Spiciness including corriander. Not a great representation of the style, but still drinkable. Alcohol seemed higher in this one."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Something about this beer is very off-putting to me. I can't really pick up exactly what it is, whether its a bad malt or yeast, or the combination of the yeast and malt, but I am not liking this beer. Looks good, but smells a little weird and tastes a little weirder. There is this dominant smell/taste that is just pungent/borderline awful to me. I tried to be nice, because I think its on purpose, but I can barely get this down. Sorry. Very sweet, has characteristics of a Heffe/Belgian, again there is something pungent dominating this beer."}

M: Light mouth with tons of carbonation tickles the tongue but this never feels thin always brings a lot of flavor to the party D: may I have another? nothing wrong with this beer."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Review #50 341 mL bottle, poured into a snifter at cellar temperature. Bottled on: February.2011 Thanks to EnemyWithin for this one! Appearance- Pours a dark black completely opaque colour with no light penetrating anywhere on this one, average pour yields a nice fluffy one and a half fingers of tan mocha head that quickly dissipates to a nice ring around the glass and a nice bubbly top as well till finish. Smell- I get a very strong aroma of coffee coming from this one first and foremost, followed by a nice roasted malt smell, almost a burnt aroma. The coffee is definitely the most dominant in this one although you do get a slight hint of dark chocolate thrown in there as well. Taste- First off this is a very well balanced imperial stout, and definitely rivals that of some of the best stouts that I have tried thus far. Just like the smells, coffee is mainly predominant in this one although you do get a nice balance of the roasted malts and a slight hint of dark chocolate in there as well and a pleasant burnt malty taste in the finish. Mouthfeel- Medium to Full bodied with above average carbonation for an imperial stout, this one goes down smooth and creamy, very rich on the palate finishing with a nice burnt smokiness. Overall- An amazing imperial stout although a little heavy on the coffee flavours at times although it is very well balanced by a perfect amount of roasted malts and a slight hint of dark chocolate. The smells again are of a lot of coffee then the taste comes through almost the same as well but it finishes with this very nice burnt malt smokiness that is very pleasant on the palate. Hides the high ABV very well, I cant even taste any alcohol in this one what so ever, dangerously easy drinking, smooth, creamy and rich. A definite go to if I could ever find this one again, please bring this back to Ontario!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "Billed as an Octoberfest/Dunkel cross this tastes like an Octoberfest/Dunkel hybrid. A-Looks like a lager...relatively clear amber with a light white head. S-Munich malt evident on the nose with a nice toasty malty aroma... T-Pretty sweet...toasted notes are evident along with some sweet caramel notes as well...perhaps a hint of milk chocolate but it is very light. M-Can seem a little too sweet at times....right on the edge...decent body for being just 4.5%...but certainly easily drinkable. D-I had a liter of this at the bar during a Twins game while passing through town and also brought home a growler. I find this to be another enjoyable McCann's beer. Nice hybrid that is unique and tasty. Excellent dark selection for the summer. I imagine this one will be quite popular."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I've had this bottle in the basement for a while and there's no date on the bottle. I believe this is either a 2005 or early 2006 though. Appearance: Cloudy reddish-brown with a big head and nice lacing. Smell: Sweet candy, ripe fruits, a little alcohol. Taste: Sweet raisins and caramel/toffee malt, with a touch of resiny bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel: Creamy, a little coating. Drinkability: Very tasty and reasonably priced. A little strong to have more than one bomber at a sitting. I wish that Great Divide dated their bottles. This was a tasty treat with a little age on it. It definitely did not have the hoppy sting of fresh barleywine but still was not overly sweet. Very good stuff."}

Very little head was achieved despite a hearty pour. A tiny collar of white foam lingered. Smell was of rum-soaked fruitcake. Big malts. Taste was sweet and malty. Alcohol was evident. Hops brightness poked through, but barely. Mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied. Not my favorite Founder's offering but I tend to like hop-heavy beers rather than malt bombs."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is slightly toasted, crackery grain, lemon and just a slightly spicy note, really slight. Lemon and grain on the front followed by a bit of spice (again, just a slight bit) and then a long persistent, bitter finish. Not really a pleasantly floral hop bitterness bit more of an acrid bitterness. Carbonation is a bit unrefined as well, I wanted something a little creamier given the style. Definitely not one of Boston Beer's finest, although I remain a fan of some of their other stuff."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours light orange with a a thick one-finger head. Aroma is hops and citrus. Tastes like a pretty classic west coast IPA, good strong hoppiness with an acidic, citrusy finish. Cleansing to the palate, highly drinkable. Nothing really remarkable or unusual about the beer but there's no knock on being a standard, reliable west coast IPA. This beer seems to be more available every day (in the Northwest), I'll certainly look for it again."}

D - Drinkable in warm weather out on the deck, but I'm not all that jazzed about this offering."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from a bottle with a brewery freshness month of August into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Summer Ale appears a light golden yellow color with a slight touch of haze and a thin white cap of head supported by constantly rising bubbles of carbonation. A spotty amount of lace clings to the glassware. The aroma is filled with a lemony scent on top of wheat and spices. Taste is pretty much dominated by wheat with an upfront flavor of lemon and a bit of spice and pepper on the backend. Light feel with a very lively amount of carbonation. Overall a pretty decent warm weather wheat beer. As it warms, there is a change in the flavor and the lemon flavor starts to get to me. The lemon character seems out of wack and doesn't really mesh well with the rest of the flavor of the beer. It's a good lawnmower beer to drink on a hot day but to sit down and enjoy it I am having a hard time getting through just one. When I had this before, I distinctly remember the character of the grains of paradise being totally dominating in both the flavor and aroma. The lemon character was slim to none but it was there. I don't know if that was from a previous recipe or maybe that has to do with the freshness. Regardless it was an interesting example of the style."}

The hop characteristics are shown off well here with the caramel and alcohol taming them a bit. Taste of pine, grapefruit, lots of resin, and some caramel, with a very bitter finish.

Creamy white head fades gradually to a thin film, which is atypical for this beer. Hazy golden beer with apricot colored hues. Inviting aroma of bubble gum, banana, dough, and a bit of lemon and sugar. Bubble gum, wheat, and dough flavors blend together in the flavor, and are accented by hints of citrus. Finishes with hints of banana it has a soft marshmallow finish. Soft fluffy mouthfeel is akin to drinking a cloud.

{"label": 2, "text": "Appearance is a brownish amber with a big white head. Nice aroma, with fresh citrus hops and some underlying caramel malt. Smelled like a some hopped up red ales, but flavor destroyed that comparison. Sharp biting hops including the unmistakable herbal taste of Summit hops. Malt provides a nice, slightly sweet balance to the hops, but is light enough that this could easily be mistaken for an IPA. Carbonation level is about medium with a lighter body and overall slick feel to it. Typically Im not a big fan of Summit hops when theyre present in great enough quantities to be very noticeable (GUBNA really tainted this hop for me), but Town Hall did a nice job with the blend here. Seems to be just the combination where the Summits provide some unique character but are tempered by more typical flavors of C-type hops. Really enjoyed this one as did all whom I shared the growler with."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Rugged Trail is a beer that I've had many times, but I never got around to reviewing it. Now it is at the end of its line, as Troegs plans to stop brewing it, so I figured I would make a point to write a review of it. Rugged Trail has a mahogany colored body with ruby highlights and a lot of carbonation bubbles. A thick tan head rises about two fingers in height, and it has good retention. Some pretty nice lacing is left behind. The aroma has caramel, hints of bitter chocolate and an earthiness. Caramel and toffee are up front, but they are tempered with bitter chocolate and even a touch of coffee. Surprisingly, the chocolate seems to be the dominant flavor. A little bit of roasted malts are in there also. There is a touch of earthy, nutty flavor in the middle. There is just a hint of hops that come out in the finish. Rugged trail is definitely a malty beer and it is pretty good. It tastes like a mix of a brown ale and a porter, which I guess makes sense considering the brewers always say they don't care about style, just their personal taste. The body is medium to light in heft, and the carbonation is on the lower side. Rugged Trail goes down really easily, and the fairly low ABV makes sure you don't pay for it. Rugged Trail was never my favorite in the Troegs line-up, and when I bought sampler cases they always seemed to be the last to go. I like it, but I don't think I will miss it too much."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I poured this into a big ol' glass mug so I got a nice rocky head to go with a slightly hazy orange/copper color. This beer drinks like your typical, solid English pale ale. I find many EPAs possess a certain je ne sais quoi in the nose and flavor that seems to be somewhat earthy or minerally in nature... or something to that effect. This is the second time I've tried this beer and it's better now than it was the first go-around. I think there may have been something off about that first bottle because now I find this beer to be quite enjoyable as a basic EPA, and imminently drinkable. Worth a try if you want something simple yet satisfying."}

A - A good looking beer, a bit more amber than I'd expected but pours a huge head with lacing all over the glass and foam lasting throughout the glass. Generally it looks a bit like an American Pale ale but with higher carbonation and champaign style bubbles. S - Smells a bit of plum, clove and fruit.. no discernible hop aroma to me at this point. T - The beer really shines in the taste dept... Starts off a little tart and then follows with a fruitiness and med body with a bit of funk or horse blanket or whatever you want to call it. A dry finish and lasting aftertaste with a warming alcohol note in the very end. M - It's smooth, and soft and 'balanced' (whatever that means). Mouthfeel is really fantastic on this beer.. O - It's certainly a good to great beer, maybe not my personal favorite trappist beer but absolutely in the high class category. I would wonder if the best buy date of 2015 isn't a bit hopeful though?? Not a super high alcohol offering and by '15 this would certainly be a completely different beer. If you like the belgian funk in your beer.. this is a great example though. Certainly brings along visions of the European countryside and has a tartness, dirt and attitude about it that doesn't taste contrived in any way... I know that's a strange statement but if you've tried a lot of other attempts at a beer like this.. you probably know what I'm talking about."}

There is an intermingling of pine and citrus hop notes with espresso & roasted malt notes, as well as a bit of chocolate. The beer has a thickish, creamy body. This beer is aggressively hopped, at least considering that I was not expecting much in the way of hop character in this beer. The fresh, herbal hop notes actually are the most distinctive part of this beer. Running throughout is a sweet, malty chocolate note that finishes out with an astringent sharp espresso note. This beer has notes of bergamot, grapefruit, and pine. This beer is perhaps a little on the light side, and could of course use a bit more malty notes to help tame the hop notes, but I am definitely enjoying this right now. This was a surprisingly pleasant beer, from a brewery that I honestly have not been all too fond of."}
{"label": 2, "text": "On tap in a pint glass at Bodega on 7/22/10 Reviewed as a Cascadian Dark Ale Dark brown, though light is able to pass through. At times seems like tobacco, crimson & ruby highlights. 1/8th inch head quickly skims out. Hardly any retention. Lacing picks up about halfway through but dries out quickly. Smells of American hop goodness; definitely CDA worthy. Pine & juicy citrus aromas - grapefruit & orange. Dark malt notes that don't seem sweet. Faintest hint of dry roast. No booze. The dark malts come across as more assertive to taste. Roastiness is more pronounced & full-flavored. Notes of cocoa, dark chocolate, caramel & maybe a spot of molasses. Definitely a dry malt profile. Still, the hops aren't overwhelmed, though they are kind of muddled. Pine tar offers a modest bitterness. There's a citric element that seems largely concealed. Full bodied, sticky & resinous - a dense brew for sure. Some appreciable alcohol slickness, but not hot. Moderate carbonation has its work cut out. Roasted, piney & juicy residuals linger. Rather impressive. Tasty, with a nice aroma & well-hidden abv. Overall, a solid representation of the CDA style, as opposed to a hoppy porter (though at times it wants to lean toward the latter)."}

{"label": 2, "text": "This was a sweet extra from raoulduke37. I could not find any kind of date on the bottle. Poured into a tulip glass clear amber, with small off white head. Decent lacing. Nose is faint; hard to detect... citrus, pine, a hint of granny smith apples, caramel. Holy crap this beer is bitter! I appreciate candied pineapple, caramel, pine, and flowers. The bitterness is huge on the palate, but I still feel like caramel is the most prominent flavor. If you ever wondered what bitter caramel would taste like, try this beer. Although, the bitterness is intense, the malt backbone is strong enough to support it. Also, the complexity of flavors from the hops prevents the bitterness from overwhelming the palate. However, if this were my ideal DIPA, there would be a bit more complexity. Although, the hops flavors are a little hard to appreciate over the bitterness. Overall, the flavor is nice, and pretty close to what you would expect from something with the phrase \"triple hoppy\" on the label. The mouthfeel is luxurious. On the thick end of the spectrum for the style; very smooth and soft. Good carbonation. The bitterness hurts drinkability a bit, but it gets better as it warms. However, if you take the ABV into consideration, it's not bad... especially warm. Alcohol is really not noticeable at all. This brew displays a welcomed originality. I would be interested to try other styles from this brewery."}

Okay, on topping glass, it leaves a bit of sheeting... Or at least it tried. S: Quite light, a bit more of a 'bakery section of the grocery store' without the big, full 'bakery scent' of a full scale operation. T: Not too shabby, a taste of rye bread, and a touch of sugary goodness. Not a sweet, watered down soda taste. M + D: Sparkling and even dry. It isn't quite as refreshing as I hoped, but alright. I'd wouldn't reject a revisit."}

Great 3 finger head, fruity taste and hard to discribe unless tried. Very expensive so hard to make it a session brew, but nice to have a few bottles lying around when the kids go to bed!! Excellent beer!!"}

It has a warm, black and roasted malt scent along with a dry, earthy character. The taste is good as well. It has a stiff, warmth that comes out and grabs you. The malt bill is well crafted with loads of roasted and caramel malts. This is a slow drinker, but one with lots of character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well crafted IS. It's complex and flavorful with the perfect amount of heat."}

{"label": 1, "text": "This one poured a cloudy dull yellow/orange. An inch of white head came and left quickly, leaving not much of a lacing in my case. Nose was more complex than I was anticipating, almost like a witbier. Strong notes of coriander stood out above banana and citrus with a very wheaty back. Flavor was pretty complex as well, but a bit sour IMO. Wheat, coriander and citrus were the big 3 behind a distracting abundance of carbonation. The finish was brief and clean. Carbonation was way overdone, it distracted from the flavor. It was very sharp, almost felt like drinking coca-cola. The flavors were good, but the beer fell mediocre. Refreshing....yes, good if your in THE heat."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Second Hoppin' Frog beer in two nights. Thanks to nlmartin for this one, too. Umm...black, that describes it well. Half inch of brown head on top, truely brown. Reduced to a skim layer with a ring around the glass. Dark toasted malts, or course, but with it comes dark chocolate, a bit of charcoal and smoke, black coffee as well. Has a touch of acridness from the oatmeal. Some lactic acid notes round this out. Lots going on here. I hope it tastes like this. Yup, it basically tastes like the smell! Almost exactly the same. A bit biting when it first hits the tongue, then a slathering of dark chocolate and toffee flavors after the swallow. Finish has a touch of smokiness. Good stuff. A bit of alcohol is evident and probably adds to the biting nature. Full bodied, not as thick as the true greats like KBS, but its slick and oily on the tongue and the flavors linger well after the swallow. Good drinkability. This is a big beer, no doubt, but its super tasty and how I like my stouts with its huge roasted and dark character. A bit biting though and while the alcohol is pretty well hidden its effects on the stomach are felt quickly. I would drink this often if it was available to me. A must try."}
{"label": 2, "text": "My first Mission beer. Might as well be one of my favorite styles. Pretty much your quintessential Double IPA in looks, with a long-lasting, creamy dirty-white head; thick foam sticking to the sides of the glass with the slightest tilt; reddish-copper sunset color; lots of bubbles racing up to meet the undying head. Ooh...the aroma promises my kind of DIPA: citrusy, candy-like sweetness, generous toffee-like malt backup, pine resin. Pretty full-on \"big hoppy beer\" type nose, and I'm hoping it impresses the taste buds as much as it does the nostrils... Lots of impressions on the tongue, that's for sure. Sweet cherries; grapefruit/orange zest; leafy green bitterness; fruit-flavored pipe tobacco; peach; papaya; strongly-steeped herbal tea; pineapple. Bitterness pervades just a smidgen over all else, which is nice, but keeps it a very slow-sipping \"whoa, take it easy\" kind of beer. Overall fruity sweet, hoppy (of course) and with a little more malt backup than others of this style. Round and full in the mouth, a creaminess tries to dominate but is held in check by a bubbly carbonated tickle. A bit sticky too, which helps keep that bitter \"west coast-type\" hoppiness going a long time... I should have never looked at the overall score here (as of this writing, just a \"B\") because I've been agonizing about it, like, \"what's not to like?\" \"Do I not know my beer?\" \"This is great a Double IPA, WTF?\" \"Are you all nuts?\" But whatever, to each their own. Lemme turn that \"WTF?\" into \"FTW!\""}

Slightly tart with a low bitterness and a sweet finish. I must say this is probably the best wheat beer out of Central America (though probably the only one as well). I was expecting more of a bland American style wheat and was nicely rewarded by one with Belgian leanings."}

{"label": 1, "text": "I got this bottle in a trade with jwc215. Thanks Joe! This beer pours a bright and clear yellow gold with a small head of foam. The foam quickly disappears as does the lacing that I got early in the session. The last pour brought some hazy goodness which gets points for me but the way the foam disappears so quickly is a downer. The smell has notes of vanilla, citrus, pretty strong cherry, some earthiness, and some alcohol. The taste brings some good cherry flavour to the forefront with vanilla, earthy/bready malt tones and some citric tartness. Further into the session, I'm starting to notice a sweetness, from candy sugar?, that works pretty well with the other flavours. I also notice the alcohol as it's giving me some warming during and after the swallow. 1 bottle of this at a sitting will definitely do it for me. The mouthfeel just creeps over into medium territory, the carbonation is on the light side, and it finishes with a slight bitterness and a very light horse blanket note. Bottom line: This is a pretty tasty Saison but I think I'd prefer my Saisons without a particular fruit that dominates....it, for me, detracts from what I enjoy in the style."}

Thats all I really got out of it, there may have been a hint of coffee but the vanilla really stood out to me. Taste was the same though the coffee came through a bit more. Really sweet tasting, and honestly had a cream soda like taste to it which I'm not completely sure I'm down with haha. Overall not a bad taste just not what I really want to enjoy in a beer. Pretty good mouthfeel however, thick, which is what I want in a stout. Drinkability is average, above average at best. At leas the alcohol is hidden well. Not something I would drink a lot of in one night or even often. I may pick it up again but most likely I would pick up other Southern Tier products instead. I'd say it's worth a try but it's pretty sweet tasting and strong on the vanilla. Nothing wrong with that if you really like that kind of thing."}

{"label": 2, "text": "A friend of mine recently returned from a trip to Holland with this beer in tow as a gift to me. Wow! That was very generous. I thought I hadn't seen this particular one in the US, but this just seems to be a 500ml bottling of Koningshoeven's quadrupel, which is widely available. I've had this beer on at least one other occasion. Firstly, the squatty, ceramic bottle is just too cute! The brew pours a dark, nutty brown into my pink elephant, Delirium Tremens snifter. A substantial off-white head formed, and it remained in some form for the entire life of the beverage. The smell is exquisite; there are aromas of ripe raisins, dark malts, caramel-colored soda, and brown sugar to be found here. Rich, dark fruit and candy sugars dominate the taste, while banana, sweet bread, and a mild spiciness linger in the background. As the brew warms the flavors become more pronounced, making for a more complex taste experience. Of course the alcohol is moderately high at 10%, so it's best to take it easy. My 500ml bottle allowed for two snifter-full glasses, which was plenty for a lightweight like me. All is good in Koningshoeven land! This has to be one of the best-if not THE best-Belgian quads I've tasted."}

{"label": 2, "text": "One of my favorite brews for hot weather sippin, always refreshing. Extremely pale straw yellow color with a dense head of pure white. It is relatively clear until I do the traditional swirl and pour, unleashing a cloudy burst of yeast which hazes the beer wonderfully. Nose is a nice balance between sweet and sour. Sweet oranges, spice, and unmalted wheat countered by lemony zest and green apple. Flavor is similar with a superbly refreshing sweet and sour profile. Oranges, honey, grass, green apple, lemon, and sweet spices make this a classic example of the style. Body is medium light, with a smooth and almost creamy texture. So refreshing and thirst quenching, I think I'll have another. There is a subtle nip of saazy hops in the finish that provides a nice touch of floral accents. I guess I should thank my Father for introducing me to this beer, he buys a few cases every summer, God bless him!"}

{"label": 1, "text": "So I'm actually sitting here drinking this right now, while I catch up on my other reviews. I popped it open cause, well, it's my birthday so I figured I'd kick things off with a Top 100 brew. I got a couple bottles of this from Skinnyelvis in the Secret Santa 2007 and have been waiting for an excuse to crack this one open. Things started off well - this beer looks fantastic. Dark, dark, dark, but that really nice looking obsidian-dark that makes you think \"damn, this is going to be good.\" Aroma - very nice as well. More restrained than I expected (was anticipating chocolate/coffee explosion) but very nice. Reminds me of \"kicked up\" hot chocolate and for some reason, something in the aroma just connotes \"thickness\" to my nose. Stop the presses -- my first sip reveals an overly bitter, unbalanced stout with too much of the wrong kind of hops. I must say, it was quite a disappointment. I don't know if it's that I haven't had an RIS in a while, but I really had difficulty getting past the first half glass; the grapefruity hops just killed the rest of the flavour, which includes some very dark, gourmet coffee notes and hints of dry dark chocolate. I think the oatmeal in this also adds to the sourness of the beer, throwing it off more. I have to admit -- as it's warming, I'm getting more into it. But I can't say I'm enjoying it nearly as much as I expected. Back to the good -- the mouthfeel is really nice, and the aftertaste is like that of a freshly brewed cup of pressed dark roast coffee. Excellent body, although it's got so much \"stuff\" in it that it's almost overly sticky. Anyway... I've got one more bottle of this. I'm not sure whether to try it again in a month or two, or wait a year and see if it ages (I'm not sure if this is that type of brew). I might save it for next Christmas, or have it during the next Toronto snow storm. We'll see. Hopefully I can come back and change the \"taste\" and \"drinkability\" numbers, but for now I have to be honest and leave them the way they are."}

There is also a sour finish to this stout. Many stouts have it. I usually am put off by a sour finish but on this stout I did not mind it. There is also an alcohol flavor present but it does not interfere with the enjoyment of this stout. It drinks well. It has a slight syrup feel to it.

Also has a slight vanilla oak character from the barrel-aging. Surprised to see that the hops have not faded so much after a year. There was no evidence of it's 9% alcohol content.

{"label": 0, "text": "I saw this last night and thought, \"hmm.. ale in a can?\". It wasn't until I got home that I realized it was a nitro can, and that was when I started to get excited. After it exploded all over my kitchen, I performed the engineering project necessary to get it into a big 16 ounce pilsner glass. Pouring a foamy beer from a can whose sides are wet into a curvy glass is not easy! I was very impressed with the head and the lace, the microbubbles in the head are always fun, but unfortunately it doesn't get much better from there. The color is alright, a sort of pale gold. The smell at first reminded me of Guinness, but perhaps what I was smelling is nitrogen. After I took a few sips, the smell almost completely disappeared, which brings me to... Taste? The only way I was able to get much flavor out of this beer was to also be breathing deeply through my nose. Then and only then did I detect faint malts, just a very small note of hops, and perhaps a stale smell. The mouthfeel wasn't very impressive either, which was disappointing for a nitro beer. Only large sips really give any sort of feeling other than that of liquid flowing over the tongue. The nitrogen makes the experience a bit more interesting, though. I do not think I would buy this again, at least not in can form. I am sad to say I could not even finish the glass, because I knew I had Full Sail's Barleywine waiting for me."}

An obvious woody and slightly smokey aroma emerges and leads into typical porter smells of rich chocolate, brown sugar, and some butteriness. T - This stuff keeps getting better. Early palate a moderate coffee flavor hits with a touch of chocolate. Anise follows, melded perfectly with figs, currants, and raisins. Sweetness begins fading somewhat with roasted malt and a very woody taste with a slightly smokey edge. Caramel and butter wrap things up offering one last burst of sweetness, before some bitterness from the roasted malt creeps in and meets up with some slight alcohol. Warming and pleasant. Long lingering aftertaste of fruit and wood. M - Medium to full bodied and somewhere around the low end of moderate in terms of carbonation. Solid and worthy, but this would be bordering on perfect if it were just a little bigger, smoother, and lower in carbonation. D - To be a dark robust beer with an 8.3% ABV, this is damn drinkable. One of my first \"WOW\" beers in awhile. I can't believe I've overlooked this for so long, and at the price, this is one of the best values out there. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from 500mL swing-top bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: extremely hazy medium-brown hue with a thin layer of ivory head. Not bad, but it doesn't inspire me. Smell: the aroma's got what I like: a thick maltiness with dark fruits, raisin, hints of cherry, and just a bit of an alcohol bite. Can't wait to dig in. Taste: not quite as \"on\" as the aroma. Subtle malt character is reduced, and alcohol heat is increased quite a bit. There's still a little good malt flavor here, but all finesse is out the window. It's not horrible, but I'm not impressed. Mouthfeel: medium body; relatively chewy. Carbonation and silkiness are low, though, so I can't say I love it. Still, it's not too bad. Drinkability: this beer isn't horrible, but it's definitely my least-favorite dopplebock. The alcohol really builds on the palate here as kind of a burning. I'm glad I tried it, but unless I find myself stranded in San Marino, I'm not likely to have this one again."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Presentation: 12oz bottle, bottle does say it should of been consumed before july, so I just hit the serve by date. Appearance: Basic lager appearance amber in color medium head bordering on smaller, which dissolves quickly into a thin soapy lacing that hardly clings to the glass. Smell: floral hops, sweet malt. Taste: for the smell being floral this beer has a lot of the malt in it a bit grainy. For the floral scent you would expect this beer to be far less bitter then it is. Floral in the fore taste with a dry hoppy bite, which well leaves the mouth feeling dry. 2.5-3.0 Mouthfeel: surprisingly dry for a lager. Proper carbonation but leaves the mouth dry. Drinkability: Still prefer the Brooklyn lager even if it is a bit too sweet. (although thanks to beer advocate I have been informed this a vienna lager, so maybe I cannot compare the two) Too dry to have several, but not flavorful enough to want to have several. An average lager. Perhaps the commericials are truthful enough to say it would go with any kind of meal because it in no way overpower any flavor because the flavor is lacking."}

Slight lacing, but not really sticking to the glass. Subsequent pours just stir it right back up. Great legs. S - Well, this is a really pleasant surprise. While I was expecting a typical trappist pale, this has all of the aromas of an American wild ale. Citrusy, funky notes from the brett, plus some yeastiness in the background. Maybe a little clove and spice. This is just fantastic. T - A lot going on here -- funkiness at first, less citrus than the nose, plenty of spice: clove and anise, with maybe some allspice. A bit of banana. Little to no alcohol in the finish, although it is somewhat dry. M - Full and sticky. Just the way I'd like a wild ale to be. D - This is a really unexpected treat. There's a great combination of a wild and belgian flavors here. Lowish alcohol for a belgian just makes it even more drinkable. O - I'm heading to the store tomorrow to buy at least another handful of these. Need to have some around the house for everyday drinking. Highly recommended."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A new bottled beer from DDC... I'm so happy. Dark color beer. It is dark brown with a creamy head on top. As usual with this brewery, the head stick well to the glass. The aroma is smoked!... wow I like this. I get some bacon in there too. No hops. On the taste side, it is smoked again. Everywhere from start to finish. More like a smoked wood than bacon, however. The taste is better than the smell. A bitterness in the end, however it is not strong. One good thing is the taste lingers in the mouth for a good amount of time. We note also the carbonation in the mouth. A good smoked beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Crystal clear golden yellow. Initially thick, porcelain white head recedes into a pitted, thin layer that leaves rough lace. Honeyish malt and grassy hop dominate the aroma, with secondary notes of grain husk and dough. White bread sweetness initially in flabor is followed by moist, chlorophyll rich hops and mild, vegetal DMS. Mild hop bitterness provides contrast, but lingers only briefly, allowing sweetness to quickly reemerge in an unfiltered, raw honey like fashion. Lightly bided, and mildly dextrinous, but oddly stagnant in mouthfeel. Floral burps ensue. Finishes mildly oily and slightly metallic. Perhaps not the freshest, but it still retains decent quaffability. The hop character apparently has faded considerably. \"Best before 5/4/2003\""}

{"label": 2, "text": "Nice brown amber pour with a decent helping of off-white head. It is somewhat cloudy. The aroma is a bit weak, but it has some nice sweet malt hints as well as a delicious sour smell that tingles the nose. The body is medium, and it has mild carbonation which all comes together to produce a very smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is a bit more dull than my beloved Duchesse, but it is still pretty good. The sour flavor is there with notes of balsamic vinegar. Some fruit flavors as well as citrus come in. Grains lay behind it all to bring in some balance. The drinkability is excellent, and I would have grabbed another or two if I weren't on my way out."}
{"label": 2, "text": "It pours a misty golden amber, like lemony iced tea. A few fingers of off-white head remains softly aloft for a time before becoming a varied terrain of froth. A mountainscape of lacing treks across the inside of the glass. The aroma is populated by biscuit malt and a slight general fruitiness, along with a mellow butterscotch air. Floral hops waft, capable but subdued. Upon sipping, toasted malt and a flash of berry make a dash forward before any real sweetness is overtaken by a hoppy mix of citrus floral essence and piney resin, though in a very settled semblance of a hop profile. A doughy yeast tanginess blinks on, and then off, to allow a long dry finish of comfy hop bitterness. It's a pleasant departure from over-the-top hopping, wonderfully blended and a stylistic mainstay. A bit north of light bodied, it has a creamy but slippery feel in the mouth, with a hoppy lingering glow. It's certainly got the hops, but it's not JUST about the hops. It's like a taste of Britain come to Long Island, if Britain hopped their IPA's just a bit more than usual. the crisp fresh presence grants the drinker a special glimpse into history. It's a joy to drink, and there are no regrets at the bottle of any bottle, no matter how many there might be. This is a real reason to be thankful for Southampton having made its way to my neighborhood."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Hazy orange body with two fingers of off-white head. Great retention. Beautiful rings of lace stick to my glass. Bread malt. Mild caramel and fruit notes. Citrus and pine hop aroma. Piney and slightly citric hop flavour given balance by sweet caramel & biscuit malts. Mild oranges. Between moderately and highly bitter, bitterness lasts long into the aftertaste. Alcohol is very well hidden. Medium bodied. Low carbonation. Oily and slightly chewy. The alcohol is so well hidden, it drinks like a pale ale instead of a double/imperial."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Received this from my Secret Santa! Thanks! Pours near black with a 1 finger tan head, fading to film leaving a spot of lacing or two. Aroma opens up with campfire smoke and burnt toast. A bit of dark chocolate to balance it out. Taste follows with some semi-sweet chocolate and roasted bitterness balancing a moderate level of smoke. Smoke is medium-thin bodied with moderate to low carbonation, which works more or less for the flavor profile and helps drinkability. I'm not really a fan of smoked beers, but this one wasn't too awful. It wasn't horribly smoky or terribly unbalanced or biased towards the smoke flavors, it actually had redeeming porter characteristics. I tolerated it."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Tasted by a half pint at the John Russell Fox, a JDW pub in Andover, during the chain's recent beer festival. A: pours a dark mahogany hue with a thin, cob-web like, dark beige foamy head, on top of low carbonation. S: quite fruity and slightly musty on the nose, skirted by a grapey note as well as prune-ish dark fruits. Due to the fruity theme, the dark malts are relegated to the second level, rendering a super light aroma for a Porter. T: juicy fruits, mild roastiness, smokey hints... leading quickly towards dry and bitter hoppiness that is never too much, as balanced by the fruity theme. The end is chewy, herbal, as well as aromatic in maltiness in the end. M&D: smooth on the palate, medium-bodied, quaffable... this is a light but quite complex Porter, with a sound bitter backbone to underline the juicy fruitiness."}

{"label": 1, "text": "I purchased a 6pck. It poured a dark brown with a bubbly head of white foam. The aroma was about average. It had a malty smell along with a faint holiday spiciness in the background. The flavors had a good balance. The malt profile was good, not to sugary. For the most part it tasted like a regular Sam Adams Boston Lager with spices built on top. I couldn't taste any of the spices advertised on the commercials. The spice aspect was very subtle and not very distinctive - sort of generic tasting. It also had a sour hoppy taste that cropped up now and again. Drinkability was decent. I was expecting something more. I got board with this one after the third beer. Overall, I was not too impressed with this beer. It had a taste that could easily get lost in the shuffle of holiday beers. There was nothing that made this beer stand out. I cannot see myself purchasing another 6pck. If this was on-tap at a bar with limited options I would probably order it."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Fresh on the shelves in Central MA, perfect mix-a-six candidate. A- Pours a fairly dark amber into my pint glass. A two-finger off-white head builds up and retains decently. Spotty webs of lace on the glass. S- A nice hop and malt element. Malt brings me some toasted nut and biscuit hints. Hops are floral, earthy and slightly fruity. T- Once again, a noticeable malt and hop presence. The malt is darker than I would expect in an APA, it feels like a light nut brown, toasted nuts and such. The hops are very earthy as well as spicy, herbal and floral. A bit of fruit and apple as well. MF- Lighter-end body with a nice creaminess to it. It feels very crisp and clean with high carbonation. A slightly bitter finish. Hmm, hard to call this a classic pale but at the same time it is too light to really be anything else. I like the earthy hops and nutty malt interplay. Not what I expected but it is a nice ale."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours amber with a half inch of tan head. Nice lacing. A melange of potent citrus dominates the smell. Also some biscuity sweetness. Fantastic. They should make candles smell like this. Slightly sweet and citrusy up front. An harsh bitterness totally dominates some graininess at the end. A bit too harshly bitter without enough back up. Light-medium bodied with a nice rounded bitterness. Again, more body would help with the extreme bitterness at the end, but a nice, drinkable pale ale nonetheless."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured from 12 oz. bottle to pint glass A: Pours dark brown like used motor oil...small head doesn't stick around long but leaves behind generous lacing. I love the look of dark beers but this isn't the prettiest I've ever seen. S: Tons of malts and caramel...but the overall aroma is fairly faint. As it warms just a hint of bitterness. T: The tiniest hint of hops of front followed by loads of malt sweetness and caramel. I love it. M: Complements the taste perfectly...full bodied and creamy...initial bit of carbonation on the tongue complements the mild hops but everything mellows out towards the end. D: I really enjoy this one and the fairly low ABV means this is sure to be a new session beer for me. The very thick mouthfeel might be a turnoff for some. Yet another impressive selection from Sam Adams. I had to wait a while for my local beer store to get this in because it seems to sell out as soon as it hits the shelves around here. It was worth the wait."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I should note that this is 2 months past its drink-by date. Pours a hazy straw yellow with very little head. Small amount of lacing. Smells of yeasty esters, a little citrus, maybe a bit of coriander. You can taste a faint malty sweetness, but most of the character of this beer comes through the nose. There is quite a lot of coriander flavor in there, and a tiny bit of \"noble\" hops. There is less carbonation than I would have guessed, and I think it's a bit less drinkable than it could be because of this. It's alright but if I was looking for a wit I'd probably grab something else before I got this again."}
{"label": 0, "text": "It looks like an orange-amber, fizzy apple juice. Its cloudy and pale. I imagine this is what they were going for, so I'm giving it points. It looks like cloudy champagne. The smell is immediately putting everyon at the table off. Soured grapes, grapefruit, and medicinal bitter orange aromas. A malty sweet underneath. The taste is easier to swallow that the smell leads you to think, but it is still medicinal, vegetable hinted, and soured. On top of that, add fizzy body and you've got infinium. Overpriced. My beer snob drinking buddy almost poured his glass out before someone else offered to force it down for him. Come on Sam Adams! You can do better!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "22oz bottle poured into a balloon tulip (Thanks Vitese!) A: Pours golden orange with a massive 3 finger head, white and extremely tight with great retention. I could have flown to Paris and back and the head would still be standing tall. Leaves a ton of lacing. S: Tons of simcoe: Grapefruit, pine, tangerine, and slight dank herbal quality. I get a little caramel malt and just a hint of alcohol. T: Fairly soft hop character presents itself: restrained grapefruit, tangerine, floral notes, little bit of herbal dankness, pine in the background. The pine bitterness builds to a moderately bitter finish. Moderate amount of caramel sweetness to add a little candy fruit hop flavor but without being like a barelywine. Pleasant bitterness/slight astringency (in a good way) through the finish. Fairly dry. M: Medium body, moderate to maybe very slightly high carbonation. Very fine carbonation. Fairly resinous and sticky, though smooth enough to make it extremely drinkable. Clean and bitter finish. O: I'd agree with the label, this is just an outstanding IPA. Not too bitter, not too sweet, not to phenolic, just in the sweet spot across the board. I really wish I had something like like this, it would always be in my fridge."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is the Sly Fox contract bottling... Appears a crimson toned red with a small, off-white head that quickly fizzles away into nothing. There were no traces of lacing around the glass. Smell is of sweet brown sugar, cola, with notes of raisins, and plums. Taste is of the same aromas with a bit of an overbearing sweetness, vanilla, a touch of cocoa, and molasses. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a sweetness that reminds me a bit of the Sly Fox's corked and caged Ichor. It even has the same lack of CO2 like the Ichor. What's the deal with that? Is it just a Quad problem?"}

Head fades quickly to a thin collar and has good retention from there. Little lacing is left behind in the glass. S- Nose is rather good. Smells of sweet chocolate milk with a hint of caramel and molasses. A hint of phenols is also present-which is surprising for a brew with an ABV on the lower side. T- Flavor progression follows that of a typical milk stout. Sweet, smooth milk chocolate flavors upfront with a biscuit malt backbone. Some alcohol and biscuit sourness come through for the finish-which is slightly out of line and unpleasant but its mild and easy to get past. M- Low to medium carbonation and, for the most part smooth creamy body...a little bit of a chewy biscuit consistency in there too. D- Interesting beer and worth a try. Typical for a milk stout and not the best example out there. Moderately enjoyable but 12 oz is enough."}

All of the flavors are quite mild but still tied together in a slightly complex manner. If it was stronger I'd like it even more."}

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied beer which goes down smooth. Fairly high carbonation. Drinkability: Medium drinkability.

Light bread and malt flavor is also present. M: Light in body with a medium level of carbonation.

Aromas of rich, sugary plums, candy, spicy yeast, brandy, oak, and champagne tang greet my 26 year old nose. Nice. Taste starts with notes of lightly sweet fruit (raisins) and oak. Other fruits chime ingrapes, appleswith an underlying base of sugary malt. Mouthfeel gets chewier mid-palate. As it moves into the finish, caramelized sugar and yeast take over.

Amazing aroma here. Lots of citrusy hops, grapefruit, orange peel, some pine and coriander. Pick up some faint malts in there as well. Very pleasant and inviting. T- Very similar to the nose here. Citrus is the dominant flavor. I get a powerful white grapefruit flavor, bitter but not unpleasant. Some nice orange accent in there as well. Great hop character here.

Cedar and black peppercorn suggestions are both pungent and unsurprising, but there is a savory, salty, celery-umami essence that is unexpected and fantastic. T - The taste is exceptionally rich and jam-packed full of strong flavors; impressions of black peppercorns, cigar box tobacco, dried cherry, peat, fig, and some very unusual saucy and savory notes that perhaps are in the realm of tomato and chili and torula yeast. M - Thick and strong. There is no expectations of feel fvor a beer this unusual, except that it must not be watery.

The first half is tasty burnt malts & some hop kick. The second half is all super-potent espresso - not irksome, just a tad overbearing. The espresso doesn't seem well-integrated with the other flavors; definitely bold. Oak is apparent as the beer warms. Full bodied; quite heavy & dense. Moderate carbonation provides some liveliness; it actually gets kind of fizzy mid-swallow. Very gritty. Espresso & burnt notes linger on the finish. While I don't at all mind it, I'd prefer to drink this in an amount smaller than a pint - maybe a 4-5oz pick-me-up, as it were. Yeti could shine here; instead, the espresso trumps it."}

The smell instantly reminded me of my wife's mashed sweet potatoes, which has brown sugar and clover honey; also detected some spices - nutmeg being the most prevalent, figs, and molasses. Great aroma. The taste started with sweet malts but not as sweet as I thought it would be from the aroma, dark fruits, apples, nutmeg again, and then a spicy-bitter like pleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is chewy and a little too carbonated...it'll have you smacking your lips though. The alcohol is well hidden, like you would expect from a good Belgian...you do notice it the more it warms to room temperature though but it never, ever gets in the way. This is my fourth different beer I've had from this brewery and one thing is becoming apparent: while all the beers are somehow pretty similar, they're all VERY damn good."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I had this one on tap today at Hollingshead in Orange, CA. Appearance- Light in color, a very very light amber color. It was very bubbly and clear. Smell- Peach, tropical fruit and a very fruity finish...VERY fruity smell. Definitely masked the sourness in the taste portion of the night. Taste- Sweet and very sour fruit beer that, for me, is just a tad overwhelming for the actual brew. I would prefer a slightly less sour flavor so that I could get a bit more of the peach flavor that I got in the smell. Mouthfeel- Very crisp and dry. Close to a brut champagne. Drinkability- I would get this again at the end of a night, but I would not pick it as a great everyday beer. It has a more sour taste than most of the flemish sours than I am used to. Not counting this one out, but not entirely thrilled with it."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a moderately thick, viscous black color with an amber-brown hue along the edges. Initially produces a tight thick tan head, but that disappointingly receeds quite quickly. No lacing noted. Fairly aggressive, rich aromas of charred malts, espresso beans, dark chocolate, candied prunes, figs and molasses along with a bit of nostril dialating alcohol. Thought the mouthfeel could have been just a tad fuller and thicker for a RIS of this strength. Seemed just slightly thin and spritzy. Flavor was big and muscular like the nose. Lots of complex notes of roasted malt, espresso, semi-sweet chocolate, dried dark fruits, currant and a touch of smoke and molasses. If there is such a thing as a West Coast Style RIS, this could be the prototype since the hops make their presence well known with the crisp and bitter long finish. Definitely one to seek out."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Blue Moon Grand Cru, whoda thunk? Pours a cloudy lemon straw color with a tightly bubbled bright white head that sticks around forever. I was hoping to find more in the nose, but I was sadly disappointed. Aromas of citrus, mostly lemons, pepper, spicy wheat malt, and a spice that I assume is coriander. Taste is a lemon and orange kind of feel with some spicy yeast, wheat, alcohol and some pepper. Creamy smooth mouthfeel is the greatest asset to this brew. Vibrantly carbonated, slick mouthfeel. Not bad, but definitely lackluster. I don't think I'll be buying anymore of these especially with the $10.75 price tag."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a cloudy orange color with thick foamy head that settles into a nice lacing that lasts throughout. Lots of visible carbonation bubbling up. Aroma is kind of bland consisting of crisp, light fruit and strong alcohol presence. This beer was way too carbonated and sweet tasting with a very dry finish."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a golden brown with a chunky head. Nice to look at. There's a plethora of aromas in this one. I detected much sweetness, along with nuttiness, maltiness, and several different fruits, such as prunes and raisins. The taste is sweet. I detect what seem like cashews mixed in with the aforementioned prunes. The beginning is a little watery, but it has a creamy finish. As I said, this is a sweet beer, a little too sweet. It seems like this one is just packed with sugar, and I can feel it on my tongue and lips after each sip. Not that great, I'm sorry. Above average, but not good."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12 oz. bottle, A: Pours a very light amber, small white head, sporadic spots of lace. S: Munich malt, very toffee-like. Nice sugary, baked goods notes. T: Light caramel and it gets a note of club soda, sulfur springs, makes me think it might not have been lagered long enough. It's got some rough patches for sure. Light hoppy finish redeems it somewhat, the malt flavours when they can be found are good. M: Light-bodied, smooth and crisp. D: Pretty standard fest, nothing special, solid pub beer for me, got better as it warmed up."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I love this stout! Dark black in color with a white head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Smells great! Has a complex taste. Very drinkable stout, not as heavy as most stouts, but heavy enough. Has a little bit of a nice bite to it right at the end of the tasting. This beer is really good at both warm or cold serving temperatures. Probably one of the top 3 oatmeal stouts I have ever had."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: Pours basically black, but maybe closer to a very dark purple or brown, with both of those colors coming out at different angles. Head is pretty basic but dies off not too soon after the pour. The lacing is like a layer of sand against the glass but it dissipates not too long after you tilt the glass. S: An unusual but very appealing mix of grape, plum, chocolate, caramel, a little fig, and a small woody character. They all blend together really nicely and make me quick to want to drink this. T: Starts off with a figgyness and goes into grape, plum, and black cherries then transitions into a salty caramel bite that finishes with some nutty chocolate. It's actually quite complex and very good. This is a very solid porter. M: The sensations in the mouth were very spread out in this beer, with no extra bite on the top of the mouth or back of the throat. The body was on the heavier side of medium and the carbonation was surprisingly full despite the dying head on the beer. Really good mouthfeel. O: This is probably the best thing I've ever had from Karl Strauss and it surprises me, honestly, that it's from them. Very few flaws in this beer and was a great pleasure both to drink and ponder appropriate descriptions for. I think this is very much worth seeking, trying, and perhaps trying again. I've been somewhat of a critic in the past, but big ups to Karl Strauss for this one."}

Suggestions of spicy European hops. Raisin notes. Finish holds on to some nutty/oiliness. Tastes just okay. Feels pretty good. It's kind of boring, and not all that drinkable. The alcohol is hidden."}

Something in here reminds me of olives. T: Bold caramel profile with some sulfur and a faint bitterness and notable mineral. I get some prune and date. M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth. Overall: Not really a fan of this style so not one I regularly drink, but I did like the all English version of this they did."}
{"label": 0, "text": "341ml bottle poured in a pint glass. This is a Raspberry Lager. Hazy and a kind of a red-orange colour. Off-white foamy head is 3/4 inch on the pour, but quickly recedes to a thin ring leaving spiderwebs of lacing on the sides. Smells very sweet, but reminds me of strawberry jam instead of raspberry. Doesn't even really smell like beer. Light taste of raspberries at the start with a hint of sweetness, but as it progresses towards the finish a rotten flavour starts to show itself. By the finish it's like drinking rotten raspberries. Terrible. Undrinkable. Light-medium bodied and very fizzy. Leaves a soapy feeling in your mouth. Like you accidently got some shampoo in there. There should be no way this beer has gone bad. I've had it in my fridge for only 2 weeks and I bought it right from the brewery. I can't stomach this stuff. \"Beer\" meet Mr. Drain. Review over."}

{"label": 1, "text": "What's a snake dog? Definitely seems to lean traditional English. Butter jumps right out at you, especially at the end of a belt. Velvety smooth. Leafy, toffee nose. Earthy bitterness balances out a honeyed malt fairly well but the whole package seems disjointed somehow. Lingering blood at the back of the tongue. I wouldn't pass a free one down but it's just not my cup of tea, old bean."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from 25.4 oz bottle into pint glass. Appearance: Pours a nice mahogany hue with a one-finger off-white head, not really any lacing. Smell: It smells like wine, to put it simply; tart and fruity, and I despise wine. Taste: It's much better than the smell. It's tart, sour, VERY sweet and fruity, mildly boozy, and mildly metallic. Too much sweetness, in my opinion. Mouthfeel: Fits the flavor profile extremely well; high carbonation and medium bodied, slight dryness to the finish. Overall: My first real dive into a beer that is tart and sour, and while it certainly isn't unpleasant, it's not something I'd actively seek out again. However, it has not turned me off from trying different sours, as it isn't disgusting by any means."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours black as crude, with not a trace of a colourful highlight to be found. It's black depth is abyssal. Crowned by a thin layer of relatively well retained mocha head. Really nice lace. Aroma of black licorice, dark chocolate, coffee, and whiskey. Also smells of vanilla, smoke, and wood. Palette of french roast coffee and dark fruit. A hint of smoke in the background. It's charred, roasty bitterness is intense and lingers long. You can taste the bourbon, but even as it warms it never becomes boozy and alcoholic. Very dry with almost no residual sweetness. Almost full bodied with low carbonation. Not quite chewy, but very smooth and silky feeling. You look forward to the next mouthful between each mouthful. Delicious. 2009 bottling"}

{"label": 2, "text": "Well this is my second go around with Maudite. My first attempt was bottled during the time the brewery was having bottling issues and the beer poured flat and of poor flavor. I chose not to review it. This sample is from a 4-pack of 12 oz. bottles labeled \"best before 3-17-08.\" Aroma is a mx of light fruit, heavier malt with a very light cooked (not quite roast), sweet, yeasty, spicy and a slight alcohol. Dark amber, basically clear until bottom of bottle is poured. Very big head that's off-white that settles to a creamy steady presence. Some lacing. Flavor has a nice spice, yeasty, fruity blending with a gradually building malt character (with that cooked quality). Mild alcohol. Feel is full of fizziness from carbonation that's relatively soft (without bite). Thinner feel, but not too much. Overall my trials of this beer have lacked a fullness of flavor that has any endurance. Maybe it's a product of this style, but the flavors don't build over time, I find they become less present as the bottom of the glass approaches. I love the intial tastes and smells of this beer (style?) but the intensity doesn't last."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bottle into a Cantillon tulip. Thanks to Tony for sharing. A: Clear pale amber body with a few weird worm-like chunks. One finger of frothy white foam. Mediocre retention, no lace. I'm not going to lie, it's kind of gross looking - are those sea monkeys? S: This is going to sound a bit weird, but it smells just like a Dairy Queen. I can't say with any certainty exactly what that entails (does the tangy wheat malt remind me of cheap cones? does the fruitiness recall the artificial cherry flavor of Dilly Bar coating?), but it's a remarkably vivid scent memory for me. More objectively, I get lemon, wheat, vanilla, and just a touch of lactic tartness. It's weird, but rather enjoyable. T: Tart, lemony, and vegetal. Strange herbal notes on top f the wheat and sourness. Cherry syrup on the finish (it WAS Dilly Bars!). Bizarre, but ok. M: Light + lively; nicely soft. Pleasant. O: This was anything but popular with the tasting group, and I think my weak praise for it (rooted more in nostalgia than actual admiration) is as damning as a straight-up negative review. I enjoyed experiencing this beer, but I'll not be looking for a second date. Cheers!"}

I smell leather, deeply roasted malts, alcohol, dark fruits, spices, citric hops, chocolate, and more. The taste is quite malty, with the hops in the middle, and the dark fruits and chocolate in the lingering finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and right where it should be and the drinkability is damn nice. Overall a quality brew."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Had this on tap at the City Beer Store Alesmith event during SF Beer week. The Bourbon Barrel Aged Speedway Stout is 12.5%, just a .5% more than their regular Speedway Stout. It poured an eclipse black with some light cream. It smelled like bourbon, malt, espresso, but not too overwhelmingly bourbon. It tasted like toasted malts, bourbon, but no burn. It was incredibly smooth for 12.5% and seemed more like it was created using Irish whiskey barrels perhaps? You don't get much vanilla or coconut flavors out of it- just a hint. Seems reminiscent of the Deschuttes XXI. Overall, pretty tasty."}

A: Slight ruby in hue. A hard, forceful pour leads to zero head. None. Nada. I Bobby Brown'ed the hell out of it, yet nary an ounce of froth or even a smidgen of lacing appeared. Quite dissapointing. S: Simply lovely - sugar sweet plums and dried figs. I also notice a trace of mild alcohol, but it keeps getting pushed into the background as the fruit flirts with my nostrils. T: Wow, this one is really, really sweet - it feels like my teeth are rotting. Oddly though, the flavor is wonderful: there isn't any hop presense, but what's there is freshly baked fruit cake and juicy prunes. M: Blech! It's flat. Literally flat like a tall glass of water. I don't know if this is to be expected or if it is strictly my bottle, but it's extremely unappealing. O: As you'd assume from reading the above, the drinkability is limited. Leave a can of soda open on the kitchen counter all night, and have it with tomorrow night's dinner and you'll understand. There is too much residual sugar and fruit in this one not to find some semblance of balance in even mild carbonation. The nose and flavor are there. Sadly though, there are signifigant pieces of this brew that seem to be missing, and therefore I cannot give it my recommendation. Might I also add that I'm thrilled to be finished with my Holiday catch-up. Now on to one last pumpkin ale, then back to the IPA's!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "I'd be lying if I said this beer blew me away, but it was really good. It poured a golden amber with a bubbly head that soon faded. Yeah, I'm diggin' this beer. It is a wonderful mix of hops balanced ever so slightly by just enough malt to make it very very drinkable. A wonderful beer in terms of that balance and in terms of its drinkability. Think 'American Pale Ale\" and your mind will picture a beer pretty much like this. Wonderfully done. I'm very glad Muenchenerkindl was kind enough to send this one my way. Very drinkable. Perfect for sipping on a Friday afternoon after skipping out of work early. It's great!"}

{"label": 2, "text": "I was introduced to this beer after complaining about how shitty American beers were in compairson to some of the finer foreign beers. This is a huge step up in my opinion from almost all the beers you'll find at the average college party. From bottle to going down the hatch this beer screams quality. Dark and malty it reminds of some types of Guiness and even has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Soon after it become the beer of choice to give someone who \"hates beer\". It's not perfect but it's an exceptional beer with my only complaint being it's very hard to find outside of the central US."}
{"label": 1, "text": "02 batch This beer poured a deep amber-gold with a nice white head that reduced down to a thin layer on top of the brew. The smell is complex with a fruity smell with obvious alcohol aroma's and plenty of hops. The taste starts out a bit sweet but that is quickly overwhelmed by the warmth of the alcohol. The finish and aftertaste is all crisp hops with a constant lingering of the alcohol. This beer has a definite warming effect. I'm not sure what kind of hops are used but they are not really bitter, almost more of a grassy taste. Not bad at all, I probably couldn't drink a great deal of this at one time but isn't bad every once in a while."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a deeply cloudy, amber tinted, copper color. It's topped by a sudsy, off-white head that fades to a film. The aroma is somewhat mild. There are light caramel and toasty malt notes, as well as herbal hops. Initially, toasty malts and a lightly sweet breadiness greets the palate. The maltiness opens up in the center with a bit more sweetness and some fruity hints. A strong, hoppy bitterness quickly takes over towards the finish. Herbal and floral hop flavors complement the lingering bitterness in the aftertatse, which, oddly, has aslight, lingering sweet undertone. This Bitter is light-bodied and briskly carbonated. I thought this was an excellent session beer, which fits the style."}

{"label": 1, "text": "The body of this beer is a dark, amber/molasses color. My pour leaves a large, off-white head behind, very foamy and very inviting. Each sip leaves some on the side of the glass. Floral hops takes the lead in the aroma, but is not overpowering. Other scents are allowed to develop; citrusy goodness followed by a little honey. The first sip is sweet with honey, brown sugar and caramel the most noticeable tastes. Shortly after, pine and hops tear through for an incredible bitterness that lasts through the finish accompanied by a sweetness again at the end. Medium bodied with light carbonation and is also a tad on the dry side, very nice feel, but the intense flavors and high ABV would make this one I wouldn't have many of at a time. Overall a great beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pours a hazed burnt orange, active carbonation and slightly off white head. Scent is a curious blend of citrus, alcohol and bready and caramel malt... almost an orange liqour whiff. Taste brings a quick punch of citrus rind like bitterness with a solid fruity flavor following, alcohol and malts blend together, slight oniony taste at the end. The backbone is malty but not overly sweet. Medum bodied, creamy, good carbonation, dry bitter coating finish. A decent dIPA but nothing to really jump for joy at."}

S: Nose is roast and dark fruits, prunes I'd say. Some malty-molassassy sweetness as well. No hops though, but still good. In different bottles that roast has been more or less powerful. T: Bittersweet, with the roast again present, but lighter. The dark fruity sweet is more so what's going on. This tastes a little more burnt that usual though. M: Smooth, light.

Appearance: Ruby, Amber color with a one finger, tan, rocky, foamy head. Good lacing as the head recedes. Not the greatest retention, but not bad. Aroma: A lot of malt, but a good amount of hops. Citrusy hops, a little lemony, some dry grass scent. Not the heartiest aroma, but balanced. Taste: Very bitter, but i guess thats what you get with 168 IBU's. Some citrus hops, some grassy, earthy hops. Decent malt backbone. More malt than in the aroma. Not quit the robust body I expect from a DIPA though. Mouthfeel: Big bitter finish. Minimal carbonation. Again, feels a little empty, like its missing something. Too much bitterness, not enough flavor. Drinkability: Only 8.2%, but the bitterness can be a palate wrecker. Finished the bomber in about an hour. Overall, not what I've come to expect out of a DIPA. Not enough hop character. Not very resiny or piny like I tend to enjoy more. Could use more body. While different, its an interesting take an the style. If you like interesting."}

Tangy, crackery wheat is evident and forms the base for the spicing. The lemon is quite refreshing and natural and goes well with the peppery character of the grains of paradise. Hops don't really make an appearance, which allows the spices and the wheat to shine. Finish is dry with a refreshing tingle of carbonation. A nice, and unique take on the style. It's great for hot summer drinking and pairs well with a variety of light fare."}

There is an average amount of carbonation and there is some very nice lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for a few minutes before it began to dissipate. Smell - malts, caramel, lemon juice, raisins Taste & Mouth - The beer is has an average amount of carbonation and feels creamy on the palette. Most of the taste is made up of caramel, malts, and some light hops. There are also notes of lemon juice, raisins/figs and some cask wood. The beer finishes with a slightly bitter malty and fruity aftertaste. Drink - An interesting beer that is worth a try. I prefer the citrus/hoppy IPA's but I'm happy I gave this one a shot."}

Fruity but not too sweet in aroma, lightly spicy, with hints of ginger and orange. Delightful flavor! Perfectly balanced and very refreshing. Refreshing orange citric flavors blend nicely with warming ginger (this latter aspect is pretty noticeable, though I wouldnt have guessed it had it not been on the label). Hops are flowery, and a decent peppery character finishes off the sip. The finish develops just a tiny bit of funk as the beer warms. Perfect for sipping on the patio on a warm san diego summer day, though the overcarbonation distracts from mouthfeel a bit, rendering the beer a bit fizzy."}

It looked exceptional in the glass and I don't believe i have ever seen such a dark color head in my life. Then the first sip- like playing you radio at a hearty volume with the treble and the bass both turned up to max. The battle was on between the full ainse, toasted espresso malt side and the Hops, hops, hops on the other. Big flavors in both corners and chewy from begining to end with mouth feel. In the end the hop's win and for me a oatmeal and sweet stout fan to much hops on the finish. But all in all for this style of beer one serious beer and a good one. Maybee I am not man enough and when I take off my training wheels I will be able to really enjoy this one with out a pre pouring pep talk from a highschool football coach [actually I was on the swim team and there are no really manly pep talks to a bunch of guy's standing around in speedos, footbal made for better imagry.]"}

Taste picks up where the nose left off with rich dark maltiness, lightly bitter through the middle, and alcoholic at the close, maybe a touch harshly so. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is way too easy for a beer of this abv. This Westward Ho series (or whatever it's called) could be the death of someone if they try to make the journey in a sitting."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This one is quickly becoming a favorite of mine as one of the best DIPAs that is readily available in my area. I let this one sit out for about 40 minutes to warm up then poured into a snifter. Three inches of sticky, off-white head slowly settle over a hazy, dark amber body. Easily the greatest and most noticeable characteristic to this beer is that pungent Simcoe aroma, which you could probably smell from the next room over. The smell is almost menacing, deviant, hostile, yet captivating. It's like walking into the Pine Forest of Death, with the Devil waiting at the other end. The flavor does nothing to divert you. You steer through, licking branches like lollipops. No one is around to stop you, so you think. You could eat every branch in the forest - are there are only five more in the fridge? The devil (and his 9.0 claws) swoops, but as luck would have it, the sticky sap the pine needles leave on your palette becomes wearisome, precluding you from licking the forest clean. You save those for another day, and save yourself in the process. Respect the Simcoe."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured a dark ruby into a tulip style glass. Solid finger and a half of head with decent lacing. Smell is quite hoppy w/ strong notes of pine. Slight hint of malt comes though if u look for it. Taste was hoppy w/ a definite pine oil & citrus taste up front. As the beer warms it begins to show its malt & caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was slightly lacking in my personal opinion. I like barelywines w/ a full mouthfeel & this has a medium mouthfeel at best. The drinkability was good. Every sip went down smoothly & it hides the alcohol content rather well. All together this is not a bad beer by anymeans. It just doesn't stand up to some of the other American barelywines out there."}

I absolutely love the look, smell, taste, and feel of this beer. I had the fortunate opportunity to PLZEN while working in a small town just outside of Praha (Prague) named Pardubice. The town loves it's beer and on discovery learned every pub in town carried storage variation from cask to nitro-all. Of course I was sold right away but was most delighted when it was paired with an unusual combination of beer cheese, mustard and fatty pork on top of a nice local bread. Soooo fantastic was the combination that once a month I ritualistically do the same here in the States to bring back that feel; that moment in time that I had in CZECH. On top of it all I had the great fortune to drop the work and travel to PLZEN and partake of the town that I feel hops was created... :) My twist of course, but if you were there immersion into this ideology wouldn't be that far off..."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Toubab Brewe, on tap at Craggie Brewing Company during my last visit to Asheville. Served in a pint glass. Appearance: Arrives a hazed golden, sort of a dried hay-like hue, crowned with roughly one finger of slightly dirty, beige head. The retention is good, and after it fades there remains a nice thick, soapy collar and a thin but persistent dollop of surface lace. The lacing on the sides of the glass is even more impressive, droopy and sloppy but with plenty of rocky, crisp stick. Aroma: Very weak, without much complexity unfortunately. Pale, biscuity malts make up most of it, simple and pilsen-like in nature, though they are complimented by a snappy grassy undertone. Taste: Graham cracker malts dominate the foundation, though they're accompanied by a handful of interesting hop and yeast overtones. Apples are predominant among these, as are pears, almost Kolsch-like in places. A slight snappy grassy hop note and a twinge of bitterness compliment the aforementioned well. Mouthfeel: Eruptive, uneven, likely because this one's a little on the thin side. It's not completely without body, but Craggie's affinity for effervescence doesn't do this one the favors it does some of its other beers. Drinkability: Everyone wants another Zwickelbier. At 4.2%, this one's definitely drinkable, and though it's not the most flavorful beer they make, it was solid. You can't always get extreme flavor at 4.2%, right? Good for Craggie for tackling this unique and historical style, though."}

The mouthfeel was slippery and under carbonated."}

Nose: Rich, sweet toffee, fig, dates, slight cardboard, oak, and alcohol. Taste: Slight oxidization at this point which doesn't retract from the taste. Toffee, dates and a buttery lingering aftertaste. This isn't very dimensional which is weird coming from The Bruery. Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thin, and decently carbonated. Overall: Probably my least favorite Bruery beer. I've had a ton but this is not that great of one. Pretty week at this point for a barleywine but perhaps I should've had it fresh (even though it cam as an extra). Thanks Rich btw!"}

S- Sweet belgian spices with bready notes. Bright fruits, namely peaches, come through with hints of clove. T- Slightly more complex than the nose, however the aftertaste is quite alcoholic and almost ruins the delicious flavors of the beer. To begin, a sweet yeasty, bready flavor makes its way in, introducing the spicy belgian hop profile with notes of clove, banana, and peach. All this is delicious on the tip of my tongue, but as soon as it hits the sides, harsh alcohol and an obscure bitterness (not hops) comes through. M- Lively carbonation and a good dry finish. D- Good. Overall I really like the flavor of this beer, but there's smoething funny at the end that I dont care for."}

It smells a lot like a jar of Maraschino cherries with not much else. The flavor is identical to the aroma. I get a ton of sweet cherry juice, with no malt or hops present. The beer is very sweet which hurts its drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This was better than the Organic Strawberry, but not as good as the Organic Raspberry."}
{"label": 1, "text": "2011 release. This pours a mahogany-copper with a thick, creamy head. The head leaves definite rings around the glass. Initial scent is rich malts, a bit of wine, light spice. But then there is this weird hoppy blast. It lasts briefly, and is then replaced by an almost nutty, brown ale scent. Good, well balanced flavour. There is certainly some hoppiness, but it is quite light. The malts don't ruin this, and I can pick up chestnuts, wine, raisins, molasses, bread, yeast, light bitterness. This is 11% ABV and I can't even tell. The alcohol is extremely well hidden - a very, very faint suggestion on the back of a tongue. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Rich, but not overly thick. The alcohol is dangerously hidden. The small bottle size is a pleasant surprise (most BWs I've had are bombers), and I almost want a second one...."}

Espresso, a burnt graininess. The graininess is most prominate in the middle and then it kind of fades away to a rich roasted and mild fruit finish. Long roasted aftertaste. IMHO the mouthfeel doesn't fit the style or the flavor of the beer. Lighter in body than I expected with lot's of bubbly carbonation. Overall this is a damn fine beer that shines in the most important category...taste! I'd recommend you pick this one up when you see it."}

Pours a brilliant golden orange with a mad amount of hop floaties (the only part of the beer I wasn't thrilled with). Aroma is out of this world. My favorite kind of red grapefruit juice and tropical fruit candy. Flavor matches the nose in a pretty straight forward but completely complementing way. It's a whole mouth filling fruit forward hop flavor that I really dug. The slightly viscosity of the liquid was very nice in the mouth and carried the flavor well. Overall I'm just thrilled.

Aroma and taste are rather delicate, but pleasant; dark fruits and chocolate make up most of it, and bitterness is minimal. It is not exactly a winter beer, or if it is, think brazilian winter; 45 F. Reasonably well made, worthwhile if you happen to get it fresh in Brazil. Makes for a very nice session beer while still managing to have some depth."}

A: Pours a dark brown body with a small, off-white head with ok retention and decent lacing along the sides of the glass until the finish. S: A nice, floral, hoppy smell with slightly malty undertones. T: A nice, hoppy taste with some malts evident in the aftertaste. Some hops in the aftertaste, but the malts did well to balance the hops. M: A smooth mouthfeel that was kind of refreshing. D: A nice balance of mouthfeel and taste makes this a fairly drinkable beer overall. The combination of a smooth and refreshing beer with a nice hoppy taste, balanced by some malts, makes this beer a fairly interest and nice drinking beer. Pick up one and enjoy a session with it, if you can."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Consumed on tap at the 2009 Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest on 12/04/2009. This was listed on the VIP list as a Chocolate Imperial Stout aged in Heaven Hill Bourbon Barrels and brewed by Pizza Port San Clemente. I see no mention of the regular Infamous being barrel aged so this needs its own entry. The beer is black with a light brown head. The aroma is a bourbon chocolate desert. Chocolate cookies, chocolate cake, truffles...need I go on? Despite the rich desert items I've used as descriptors, the decadence doesn't reach desert beer category. The chocolate is balanced nicely by the bourbon. Alcohol is completely masked in the nose. The flavor is boozy dark chocolate cookies with brown sugar. Booze is at a moderate level, and the bourbon is prominent. Bourbon and chocolate linger on the palate in the finish. Delicious stuff."}

{"label": 1, "text": "This is sort of my \"if I can't get something really good then I'll have a...\" brew. It seems to be readily available, especially on draft many places nowdays. I should give credit however in that this brew is responsible for opening my eyes that not all beer is filthy yellow swill. Until I had this I thought I hated beer truthfully, and now I absolutely love it! Alas though, my tastes have moved beyond this \"starter beer\" as I call it. So anyway, to the actual review: This one pours a rather nice reddish brown with a respectable head to match. The smell is actually very nice, but not overpowering. First sip yields a slight malt and hop taste, but not really strong, sort of a weak glimps if anything. It is however rather easy to drink and again, is much better than most macros. I'd take this over the yellow lager monster any day."}

A nice combination, but nothing that's going to change your world. Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and soft - when I think of an exceptionally creamy beer, this immediately springs to mind.The aftertaste is bitter.

A: pours a bold clear golden with a billowing 2 finger white head, leaves heavy lacing, appears to have good retention S: the front is pungent aromatic hops with a very orange like character without some of the pine and other tropical fruits that I typically pick up in big DIPAs. Some rich malts show up at the end with a touch of caramel and honey. Somewhat unique in the hop profile, smells good. T: huge bitter hops on the front with a lot of orange again with some pine joining the party as well. Lots of rich caramel malts throughout which balance the hops well. The finish is bitter and a touch sweet. MF: this beer excels compared to other DIPAs with a velvety mouthfeel and the perfect amount of carbonation. D: I'm glad Great Lakes put this beer out. Yes there are a ton of IPAs/DIPAs out there, but this one has some unique qualities which make it worth checking out. This doesn't quite do it for me like Abrasive/Hopslam/Double Trouble/PtE does, but great beer nonetheless."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Throw back brews, trendy hipster canned PBR does well. But why do they have to make every varietal of the same beer? Fizzy yellow beer, pale pissy golden or apple juice if you wanna be PG about it. Minimal specks of lacing left after the bright egg shell white head fades, oh so quickly. Aroma has cooked veggies and cereal notes going down efficiently enough to be classified as an industrial lager. No reason to go for this brew but for 5.99 a 12 pack of cans I had to grab it. Now I have something in my fridge to offer the folks who couldn't give a shit about my beloved micros. Don't get me wrong I still try to convert but this is a better alternative then them clearing out my DBF. Flavor is pretty much a watered down slightly metallic cooked veggies in this case corn and rice show up hard core. No real hop flow but I wasn't expecting one, I still can enjoy a PBR with the best of 'em but this one leaves much to be desired. Mouthfeel is carbonated water, carbonation levels a bit much will bring the Barney belches in no time. Drinkability overall could be pretty wreckless, but I'm not in the mood for a White Trash Wednesday party like I would have been back in college."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but trying the Dubbel, Tripel and Quad together, I'm highly confused about the Quad's significantly higher ratings. True, it's a bit better. The flavor is fuller, the malt is richer and the beer is a bit more warming, but the flavor profile is in line with the rest of the lineup with the smaller beers. I'm even lowering the rating a bit in deference to style comparisons. On a flat rating scale, this would be more highly rated than the Tripel or the Dubbel. At any rate, the Quad pours a deep medium red. It's translucent with amber highlight at certain angles. It's actually less murky than the Tripel (maybe a function of the pour). There's a bit more lacing, though. The aroma has more banana bread and clove than I noticed in the previous Koningshoeven beers. There are also aromas of vanilla, brandy and apricots/plums. The flavor is similar with peppery spicing. I'm again impressed at the depth of flavor these Trappist brewers are able to get out of such simple ingredients. It's one hell of a strain of a yeast that can impart this depth of flavor. If not for style comparisons, I'd bump up my ratings in every category."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A - deep black with brown edges. Pours a one finger mocha colored head which recedes fairly quickly with very little retention. S - Tons of deeply roasted malt, milk chocolate, tootsie roll, honey, bread yeast, slight metal, slight coffee grounds. T - A great pairing of roast and super sweet milk chocolate. The roast maintains throughout the entire taste, though it starts on the sweeter side where some of the honey found in the aroma and finishes with some burnt roast and coffee. Milk chocolate and faint tootsie flavors weave their way in, which supplies some much welcomed sweetness and balance to the serious roastiness. My only criticism is a metallic tinge towards the end of the taste that is somewhat hidden by the bitterness, but still there. M - rich, full bodied, carbonation is perfect; I didn't even have to think about it. O - All in all, this is a solid beer. A solid roast forward, mostly balanced, milk chocolate-goodness stout. And not a hint of booze at 9%, well done."}

{"label": 2, "text": "The colour is apricot-pale orange and cloudy. The minimal foam is white and built of relatively large bubbles. The smell resembles of sparkling lemonade: Sweet with a clear flavour of citrus fruits and peach. The carbonation is potent with rather big bubbles. Quite fit for the style, I think. The first taste that meets the drinker is a rather bitter aroma of marzipan and apricot brandy. Then, a complex taste of sweet almonds, dry cherries, peaches, bitter orange and some yeast emerges. The bitterness is very subtle, but it is present somewhere in there. The aftertaste is slowly decreasing, leaving a fine flavour of apricot. According to the staff at Akkurat (the fine beer bar in Stockholm, Sweden), this beer is strictly speaking only sold at a Belgian caf, but a special arrangement made this exclusive guest appearance in Sweden possible. They also explained this beer as like Hoegaarden White, but based on a Lambic instead of Witbier. The result was quite different but very attractive."}

Looks really nice, super clear, near ruby colored. A tall white head, good retention, and nice lacing. Just not quite appropriate in color for an American Pale. Smells pretty weak. Grainy malts and earthy hops. The flavor had me guessing this was an English Pale Ale, which it fits rather well. As an American Pale this just doesn't add up for me. Too much malt and no true hop flavor, only a mild bitterness. Lots of doughoness as well. Pretty smooth with very soft carbonation. Overall not bad, but I felt rather disappointed with this beer."}

The head has amazing retention and even when it fades to 1cm thickness it remains there thick and sudzy the entire duration of the beer. The glass is coated with layer upon layer of sticky lacing. Smell: The smell is mostly clean undertones of toasted malts, plenty of grains and subtle suggestions of grassy green hops. Taste: Very nice for a German pilsner style. This beer seems to have more taste than some but it is pretty straightforward (apropos for the style). The flavor seems to showcase a gentle malty character followed by a hint of grain and lemon hops. the finish is remarkably dry and lingers for a long time. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. It is a bit watery thin through the middle but it is appropriate for the style. The hops keep your lips smacking and your palate busy so you usually don't notice the watery center. Drinkability: Fantastic! I found this to be one of the best German Style Pilsners I have had to date. It is not generally my favorite style but this one is very easy to drink, refreshing and sessionable.

{"label": 0, "text": "Bottle courtesy of Piscator34: Poured a super pale yellow color beer with a very small bubbly white head with no retention and lacing. Aroma of very weak malt with some lemony notes which are just plain weird. Taste is reminiscent of a wine spritzer more then a beer with almost no malt or hops distinguishable. Total drain pour and one of the worst beers I have had the chance of trying recently."}

Tons and tons of tan head which eventually settles down. S-Yeah, that was worth waiting for. Lots of grainy rye sourness blends nicely with a sweetness reminiscent of yams. Very appealing. T-A very nice blend of rye sourness, dark fruit, Belgian yeast and toffee notes. An unusual blend but a tasty one. M-Medium bodied and a bit dry. Once the carbonation settles this is a pleasant drinker. D-Very tasty. I enjoy rye beers generally. This is a fun and different take. HV"}

A floral hop flavor emerges in the middle with moderate chalky bitterness characterizing the finish. M - Medium body, low carbonation, and a dry finish. D - Pleasant and drinkable with a nice malt character. Unfortunately the hop character is just too weak to make this a good english IPA."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a deep gold with a three finger head. The website says I should be getting vanilla and dill on the nose. That description could not be any more true. I get dill first followed by vanilla and a noticeable whiskey aroma. Very bizarre, yet interesting aroma. No hops to speak of on the smell. The taste is much smoother than the standard Jai Alai. I get tons of vanilla and whiskey initially, while the dill and hops finish things off. I don't taste a hint of bitterness. Overall, one of the more interesting takes on an IPA. While I am impressed with this brew, I prefer the regular Jai Alai more. This is not nearly as drinkable as Jai Alai and the whiskey-like taste can be a little overpowering. Either way, a must-try and I will enjoy the rest of the 4-pack throughout the weekend."}
{"label": 2, "text": "As a much younger man (21 compared to my current and much wiser age of 25) I happened to be in the lovely small town of Chico, CA doing a product sampling event on the Cal State Chico college campus. On this fateful journey, my colleague and I decided to save our per diem during the day and go big at the Sierra Nevada Taproom that night. After a nice Filet Mignon, we decided to post up at the bar in the taproom for the next few hours. It was here that I first tasted Sierra Nevada's IPA. At the time, I was amazed, it was definitely my favorite and I swore I would start drinking it as much as possible. It is a difficult beer to find outside of Chico and I have only had it once between then and now. Needless to say, I was thrilled to see that Sierra Nevada has started bottling the IPA when I found it in a tiny beer store on a cold March day while visiting Philadelphia. Unfortunately, the beer did not live up to my lofty expectations. The bright white, lacey head and amber, clear body look awesome, but the aroma and taste, although good, leave much to be desired for the brew to be as inspirational as I had remembered. The aroma is mildly hoppy, but unimpressive. The taste is crisp and pleasantly bitter, with no cojones to back it up. Other than the intitial hoppy kick, the overall body and flavor of this beer are almost non-existent. The bitterness remains long after the beer is swallowed, which I like, but there are really no other interesting flavors to describe. I would love to say this beer is still a favorite, but alas, 'tis not. Will I drink it again in the future? Of Course. Will I be making the long drive to Chico anytime again soon? Not for this beer."}

Quite different than my notes of the 2010 vintage. I can see how this can be a polarizing beer. Good bitterness but not off the charts. Strong malt backbone. Will probably cellar one. Do have a 2010 I will crack open soon for comparison. Original review, August 5, 2010: 12oz bottled on May 28, 2010. Pours lightly hazy orange/amber/copper with a one finger light tan head, leaves some spots of lacing and holds a light foamy cap. Aroma is heavy earthy, grassy and floral hops, some citrus and pine, light tropical fruits underneath, some caramel and bread. Only moderate strength, however. Does get better as it warms. Huge flavor of resinous and citrus rind hops, some pine, very bitter, a strong caramel malt presence is here, but it is short lived as the finish is an even bigger wave of biting bitterness and a kick of alcohol that only adds to the effect. Excellent. Mouthfeel is full, oily with sharp carbonation. I love em bitter and this is one of the best Ive had yet. Appearance 4, Smell 4, Taste 4.5, Mouthfeel 3.5, Overall 4.5, Score 4.28"}

T- tastes like a floral, hoppy, piney, citrusy combination that hits the back of the mouth strongly, but has enough balance to remain drinkable M- hits the mouth with some serious carbonation, different areas of the mouth experience this beer very differently D- This brew reminded me of why it took so long for me to acquire a taste for IPAs...that being said, this is an enjoyable IPA, although I probably coudn't do multiple in an evening."}

My wife's grandfather foisted a barleywine on me that was like fermented motor oil. I've avoided the genre ever since. My eyes have been opened. This brew assaults the senses with bitter and sweet, malty and alcoholy (new word). All is in perfect, delicate balance. BIG BIG BIG flavor. More hops than can be believed. Dripping with caramel and butter. Thick and chewy. Alcohol heat. Sip or be buzzed. Wow. Can't wait to try some of the other barleywines recommended by my fellow BA's."}

Thought it would be a little more flavorful, but still ok overall. M- A little watery for my liking, but not bad. Leaves a wet taste on the tongue with a fruity aftertaste.

{"label": 1, "text": "I'm going to forgo the \"poured into a whatever\" and \"appearance was\". Appearance was like beer. Typical American big biz beer, except a bit cloudy for show. So in a nutshell, this stuff is kind of a cloudy Keystone Ice with a touch of citrus and a mini touch of corriander. And a 5.4 ABV. My advice-- Get a Keystone Ice and put an orange twist in yer glass. Then think Blue Moon. And put the remaining beer money in yer gas tank."}

Poured into a pilsener glass the head was white and lacked lacing but the color was a nice dark red to brown and filtered. Big Smoked jerky smell / malty/ bit of coffee/caramel porter type background. The taste was very new to me. This is the last of the 6 bottles I picked up recently and I've had the same feeling each time I gobbled one. The smoke flavour is nicely crafted and not too overbearing but it would be tough to drink more than one of these at any one time. I found it went nicely with some pepperoni sticks and sharp tilamook cheese w/ crackers."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed in a proper perfect pint glass. A: A bit over 1 finger of frothy white head. Barely a haze is visible in this golden straw body. S: Aromas are faint, with a lemon zest bitterness and nice aromatic offering of spice and fresh wheat. T: The flavors are pretty faint...underwhelming, actually. The grain flavors are fresh but are really the only prominent character in the beer's profile. Actually, it's really the only flavor...period. No citrus zest as promised by the aroma. A heavy bitterness lingers on the tongue, but it's nothing pleasant. M/D: Medium body and lower carbonation. Tons of bitterness is clinging to the palate. With a summer beer, I'd expect fresh, diverse flavors and high drinkability. The intense and undefinable bitterness really kills the \"summer\" ease with which a beer like this should be enjoyed."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Kudos for the flip top bottle alone - it makes bottling homebrew much easier when you have enough of these babies lying about. I poured this straight into the glass (no tilt) and was rewarded with a thick off-white head that nevertheless receded rapidly. Color was your basic brown-red; reminded me of marbles I used to play with as a kid. The aroma was the first disappointment. There's something unpleasant coming from it, although I couldn't ID it (wet dog? laundry?) The taste is equally nondescript. It starts off...beery, for lack of a better adjective. Midpoint has a flash of hop and sweet malt, which quickly vanishes to a barely noticeable aftertaste. It thankfully doesn't carry that ashtray flavor their lager does. Mouthfeel borders on watery. It lingers briefly, and then is gone. Not much kick to this one. It's drinkable, but unless the only other beer available is low-carb, there's better choices out there."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A - Very light shade of amber with hardly any head. The lacing was distinctive and prevalent. S - Alcohol, honey, and lemongrass. T - Vanilla, maple, smoky-malty-sugary something-or-other. This is dominated by sweetness certainly, but it's a complex and enjoyable combination of flavors. Unlike any other DIPA which I've had, the finish is really sweet - honey and lots of it - but after half a minute or so of sugary remnants on the tongue/in the throat, the hops sneak attack, resulting in a far longer, very bitter aftertaste. M - This is syzruzpy to the max. Heavy, sugary, and a decent amount of carbonation. D - Hmmm...I'm torn. This is ridiculously sweet, but the bitter back-end does an against-the-odds job of offsetting this. The high gravity does come into play, and I wouldn't recommend drinking too much of this. For what it is, though - an ultra-sweet DIPA - this is actually pretty drinkable. Founders likes maple syrup barrels. I like them throwing every style of beer they feel like into them. This is a very good beer, and I'm glad to have tried it. If you have the chance, this is worth a decent effort to sample - it's almost certainly dissimilar to anything you've had or will have."}

Lemon, grapefruit, floral perfume, and some mild pine flavors. Bitterness is a bit above medium giving a nice dry finish. Whoa, this is drinkable.

{"label": 1, "text": "Received this brew in a trade with tpd975. Never been blown away by a BBC beer but hopefully this is the one. Drank from my Rogue Kells Irish Lager pint glass while watching the Cowboys vs Giants game. Appearance- Pours a very hazy orange/yellow with a super soft foamy bright white head. Somehow the head doesnt recede, it only seems to grow. Leaves a huge cap and collar the entire beer and leaves more lacing than maybe Ive ever seen. Smell- Huge nose on this one. Very earthy and dirty leaning toward freshly cut grass. Citrus undertones of grapefruit pith and lemon zest are present. Not much of anything really resembling malt can push its way through the huge hop punch. Taste- Holy bitter! This thing packs a big citrus punch with lots of grapefruit and orange. Slightly sweet with a bit of a caramel backbone but very, very little. Like the smell its kind of dirty and earthy. The alcohol isnt covered well and a balance definitely isnt present. This is a hop heads heaven. Mouthfeel- Very full, almost syrupy. Nice carbonation and a bit of alcohol warming. Drinkability- Overall this isnt a bad beer but its definitely not my cup of tea. I like a bit more balance in my brews and this doesnt really have anything resembling that. Glad I tried it though and big thanks to tpd975."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The color was a beautiful dark, reddish copper, but the head was minimal and didn't last long. There's caramel and toast on the nose, no noticeable hops, but maybe a hint of fruit (and perhaps a touch of phenol?). There's sweetness on the tongue, balanced by some toasty/roasty. The sweetness seems to last a little more than the toast in the aftertaste, but they're both present. All in all, I think this is a good example of the Irish Red Ale style. I don't sense much complexity, but I'm wondering if a bit of fine tuning might push it from good towards great."}
{"label": 2, "text": "550 ml bottle poured into an Imperial Pint. No date or info to be found. A - Brilliantly clear honeyed pale amber in color. No carbonation action but a plump and dense creamy head burst fourth on the pour. The off-white beast took a long time to settle and left slight legs on the glass. Only specks of lacing though. S - The aroma comes out subtly but is very smooth and refreshing smelling. Not to be misunderstood with cidery, it has a fresh red apple aroma that's lightly tart. Light hops present a fruity and floral aspect but hardly smell like typical hops. Low aroma but not IPA-like based on smell. T - Impeccable balance on the flavor, the malty backbone starts out right away but quickly turns to a dry hop-present fruity - with that apple again - and floral kick. The finish is mildly hoppy though a touch more tart and astringent than bitter. Dry finish. M - Incredibly smooth and slightly creamy to start, it finished dry and a touch astringent, not bitter. Medium-bodied and smooth as milk all the way down. D - Pretty good, while not a typical IPA by any standards. Hop presence as we Americans know it is pretty absent. The balance is well done though."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Random 500 mL can picked up from the LCBO; this can claims 5% abv instead of the 4.6% seen here. A vigorous pour reveals an attractive translucent light copper coloured brew topped with a finger of head that dissipates rather quickly. A soapy, off-white film is left behind on top, as well as a creamy collar around the edge. The smell is very faint and not all that interesting; mostly malty, caramel and biscuits; pretty typical amber lager fare. Taste is quite approachable - lightly roasted biscuit malts, caramel and grains. There is some underlying and residual bitterness but sweet malts are the dominant flavour, which seems to be the case with this style of lager. Fairly light-bodied and watery, with moderate carbonation, just enough to make it a bit crisp. Quite refreshing for a brew that leans toward the sweet side. Drinkable, but nothing that special. I may get it again; it's reasonably tasty and quite different from standard macro fare. A good alternative to Sleeman Honey Brown, without the honey part - if you're a fan of that beer but want to try something less sweet, you'll probably enjoy this. Nothing exciting, but nothing offensive either."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Out of a bomber this beer was a cloudy, golden/wheat-color the head was two fingers of puffy, beige bubbles. The retention was great and the lacing fabulously clingy. The aroma was good with sour and tart notes of hops like green apples, grapefruit, yeast and assorted spices. The flavors were very sharp and complex as one would expect of an aged cheddar (they would probably pair wonderfully). I tasted orange zest and grapefruit peel, alcohol, toasted malt, some resiny/piney hops, a healthy dose of pepper and hints of rye. Not really what I expect from a saison but tasty. The mouthfeel was creamy and a bit oily such that my tongue remained coated after the sampling. The body was medium and the carbonation low."}

I had this beer (many times; it was a favorite!) at GABF last fall, and I'm happy to rediscover why I visited the Pizza Port booth so many times last fall. This beer pours a slightly dull red-brown, with a very sturdy head. Aroma is a combination of a grapiness reminiscent of certain Belgian ales (most recently in my experience the Gouden Carolus Ambrio) and a light hoppiness (Centennial?). Flavor is significantly different than other amber ales...it is grapey, like a Belgian ale; dry-hopped like an IPA, and has some malt balance like an amber. The amber ale style seems a bit over-exposed (as in, everyone has one, and most are not very special). This one is quite unique."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Reviewed from notes. Another tall can from Tallgrass. Dark clouded amber in color with a good two fingers of soapy head that doesn't stick around for long, but at least the lacing left behind is pretty to look at. Just about every category of hopping scent (including an amazing initial burst of my favorite, tropical fruit) is present all at once in the nose, somehow maintaining balance with each other and with a strong backbone of malt scent. The taste is much of the same story, the main difference being that the flavor also includes significant aspects of pine resins and the malt has somewhat of a 'salted savory peanut brittle' nutty feel to it that I really enjoy. As it warms up towards the ambient room temp, it takes on a slight vegetal nuance that is the first time (aside from chile beers of course) I have ever tasted in a brew that a vegetal flavor was appropriately balanced against all the other flavor components in the beer. Texture is on the thicker side of medium, carbonation is aggressive enough to keep it from being sluggish.. This is a really well done and very complex Big Beer, I highly recommend giving it a shot."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This was hard poured from a bomber bottle and I knew it was something unique. The color is dark reddish brown; I think you might call it copper. The head by the way really sticks around and leaves a lot of lacing behind. Do not be afraid to stick your nose in there deep as to inhale all the citrus like notes that lie within. The taste is wonderfully hopped and the rye makes itself known as well. With an 18% rye content it is no wonder. But this ale just gets better and better as you work your way to the bottom. If you love hops then you will have found your match. The mouthfeel and drinkability are only matched by how much alcohol you can handle. I can handle another thank you!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: Pours a light head cover into my oversized snifter glass. It's a very clear amber orange color, for which the head fades to nothing pretty quickly. N: A decent mixture of hops and malts. A nice chewy hop aroma with a little pine and slight citrus. There are quite a bit of crystal malts as well. A slight grapefruit aroma comes out on the pour only, very slight. T: Starts with a chewy hop taste, imagine that. Lots of crystal malts and other semi dark malts come out, almost a slight roasted malt, some Munich malts almost, lots of nice malt flavors. More hops follow with some spicy hops on the lighter side, more citrus, pine, and a touch of grapefruit. Lots of different hops blended with various malts, a decent blend. M: Chewy hops, very light carbonation, and semi thick body. F: Pretty bitter, not so much, decently dry, a slight piney long finish. The slight chewy hop taste seems to hang out just before the piney bitterness hits for the long finish. A decent malty hoppy beer that doesn't excel in any specific category, but considering its called a hoppy amber ale, I think it hits right on the nose. It's not an IPA, and it has a really nice malty quality. It's only real downfall is the lack of carbonation."}

Sweetness is light, and dextriny, with hints of grain and dough. Quick flash of a citric and salty hop bitterness flushes to palate with a seltzer-like taste and makes way for a light bready finish.

Some notes of bread and biscuity malt pops in occassionally. Some hints of diacetyl or butterscotch, hints of ale yeast over lager strain? mouthfeel is big for lager style beer, with a lot going on but as much as I love hops it is just too overwhelming for this style, even at an \"imperial\" level the balance is not even close to were it should really be, but certainly brewers perogative, but I do wonder if this was even brewed to be in the lager family, perhaps it is just coincidence but at the bottom of the bottle label rests a tiny \"ale\" marker. this is a beer worth trying, and I am going to sit on a few of the bottles to see if and how they mellow and progress, as always Cheers to Jim Koch and his crew, this is not a bad beer just not strictly to the mark for style."}

Vanilla beans and a slight oily nuttiness round out the nose. Taste: Sweet chocolate malt, roasted character is present as well. Chocolate becomes bittersweet midway through, finishing balanced. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Simple, but incredible. I have not had any stout this perfectly chocolatey. Mouthfeel: Creamy mouthfeel, feels lightly carbonated. Slightly syrupy feel afterward, but not bad. Drinkability: This is an impressive sipper. Not something I would want to drink quickly, but aside from the tastiness of the beer itself, the unique chocolate character provides for niche dessert pairing purposes as well.

Chewy hop resin make it fairly bitter while the malt sweetness struggles to take control. Dark chocolate caramel chews come to mind, dark toffee and stewed plums.

{"label": 2, "text": "New Beer ?Thursday? Heck yeah. Beginning of spring break for me (not that it will be much of a break...get to edit my forty page paper for law school, yippee). Moving on... Appearance - Pours into my SA Perfect Pint with a remarkably clear, amber color. About two fingers of white, fluffy head is achieved with a moderate pour, and from what I can tell it is leaving pretty decent lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell - Pine, hops, herbal, just a hint of mint, and after that all fades a bit of malty/bready scent. Taste - Pine at the forefront followed by a heavier floral note - not as much citrus here as I was expecting (granted I didn't smell much in the nose but I was expecting a bit more). This is a more-so bitter/hoppy/skunky IPA than some I've recently had so it is actually a good change in pace. Accordingly, it is pretty damn balanced - a nice bitterness up front followed by a not-to-sweet malty backbone finish. Mouthfeel - Medium to a bit light, crisp carbonation. Drinkability - Pretty good/drinkable. At three dollars for a 22oz bomber you really can't go wrong for the price and it has a nice little alcohol kick to it (which you can't taste - it isn't that potent but decent from a more mainstream brewer such as NB). Pretty good, but honestly, when there is Pliny at the same store I got this at, I'd rather spend a dollar fifty more to get that. If I needed to bring an IPA to a party and nothing else was readily available (which definitely could be the case) I would for sure bring this. Good session beer."}

Pours a deep, clear but not quite translucent amber with bubbles rising in the middle. No lacing. Smell: Big and inviting smell of vanilla, coconut, some sweet malt, and (most of all) whiskey. The aroma calms down as I get through the bottle. Whiskey stays at the forefront, while the vanilla and coconut pull way back, though they don't disappear. Taste: First sip is a creamy hit of vanilla and coconut, with whiskey and some hops entering fast and sharpening up the flavor, then a smooth malty finish. The nice oak and vanilla flavors color the whiskey and malt notes. It's clear right away that the aging has vastly enriched the flavor of this beer. The whiskey influence is perfect. My only complaint is that the malt notes are already rather subtle on the first sip, and get dominated away as the beer warms and I get deeper into the bottle. If the malt could stand up to the whiskey, this would easily be a 4.5 or 5.0 scoring beer. Even so, the flavor is bold and good enough to keep me interested for the entire bottle. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and occasionally creamy, with lively carbonation. I would prefer it to be a bit fuller-bodied. Drinkability: Very good. It has a really nice whiskey character with just 6%~ ABV. A better mouthfeel would raise this a bit, but as is I'd be happy to have another bomber of this to myself. Honestly, before this beer I've never been impressed by Dead Guy Ale, or anything I've tried from Rogue. Dead Guy isn't a bad beer, it's just not a great beer. Apparently aging it in whiskey barrels makes it a great beer. The harsh whiskey note is exactly what it needs, given that my main complaint about Dead Guy is that it's too bland and sweet. The whiskey barrel aging gives character to the sweetness and boldness to the flavor (and aroma) as a whole."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from 12oz bottle(room temp) a hazy light gold with lots of carbonation and a huge head of foam that grew in my goblet until it almost overflowed. When it finally does settle down, it leaves a fine layer with some lacing. The smell is very hoppy, bitter hoppy with some fruity tones, mostly grapefruit, there as well. The taste is very big on hops up front with strong bitterness but there's a bit of malt in the background that comes through and it tries to tame or at least balance out the hops but it's only partially successful. This one is *still* all about the hops even though the 12ozer(XS series) is probably a couple of years old and then.. there's the 9.20% abv. It is noticeable but doesn't \"burn\". Bottom line: This is a good cold weather sipper that's worth buying from time to time. Edit: 2004 12oz bottle courtesy of rpohagan. I poured the beer into my NB goblet and it is a cloudy dark gold/red that when I hold up my glass to a light, I cannot see the light at all. A nice 1\" head of foam here with superb lacing. The smell is...oh so inviting with a still massive hop aroma of pine and citrus grapefruits and a bordering on maybe crossing the line of some tropical fruitiness. There's some nice sweet notes from the malt here as well that figure in just right considering how long this has been cellaring and grows in intensity the more whiffs I take. The taste is different than what I expected from the smell. The malt brings a buttload of caramel sweetness tempered by *very* light and I do mean *VERY* light bitterness that is just that....bitterness. No signs to me of any real citrus or pine or tropical fruits...just plain old bitterness pure and simple and the balance it creates with the malt is in a word, superb! Bottom line here is that I had no clue as to what ~7 years would do to this DIPA so what I'm finding is surprising the hell out of me. For the most part it is medium bodied thinning out some towards the finish and it has ample carbonation. Drinkability? Time did wonders with that. Fresh, I found it too hot as many others did. This cellared bottle was one of the easiest to drink big abv brews I have ever had. If you have any of these bad boys in your \"cellar\", give one a go right now. A: 4.5 S: 4.5 T: 4.5 M: 4.0 D: 4.5"}

I'm usually not a big fan of smoked beers (my Nils Oscar Rkporter review, for example, were among my worst reviews), but this one is...just wow. Once again coffee and smoked ham. Salty roastiness and very subtle bittering hops. Outstanding to say the least M: Thick, but mild despite the saltiness. Usually I think the smoke flavor takes too much space in rauchbiers, but it never does with this beer imho. D: Very good for this style, but you can't drink too many in one sitting Conclusion: Great rauchbier! It's beers like Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier that make beer tasting so exciting, inspiring and fascinating! Dark red liquid with tan lacing and coffee and tobacco smell. Smokey overall smell/aroma/flavor, but not overwhelming compared to other brews in the style. Smoked ham, salty meat dishes and coffee are the greatest characteristics of the taste. Would work great with (obviously) smoked dishes, pork and fish (smoked mackerel comes to mind) or even ye ole' BBQ."}

Has a lightly sweet/acidic, moderately bitter, burnt straw malt taste with a strong grapefruit hops flavor. Light to medium bodied, dry slightly syrupy texture, soft carbonation, and a heavy metallic and moderately astringent finish. Too much bitter and burnt flavor, the grapefruit flavor is too much, and the heavy metallic and astringent finish lingers the grapefruit and burnt flavor."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bottle (2011) Lost Abbey Brewing Company San Marcos, CA A cloudy auburn with golden edges. A thin head that falls away quickly. Leaves incredible sheets of lacing. A bigger, stiffer head would have made this beer score markedly better. The aroma is of hops but they're very muted and distant. The nose seems balanced with plenty of malt character but it comes off as disappointing and lacking because the hops are present, but they seem so far away! A malty red ale with a candy sweetness and a burnt sugar caramel note. The hops add a touch of bitterness, but this is a malt-forward red ale, which isn't by definition a bad thing, but the label advertises a \"lethal amount of hops.\" I'm afraid I don't find that here. Medium to full body with ample carbonation. Not an overly drinkable beer. The candy sweet malt and the muted hops don't make for a great combination in my mind."}

It's really not overpowering though which is something a lot of other winter seasonals fall prey to. One to look forward to every year. Recommended."}

T: The taste is fruity and sweet with flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and caramel. There's a complimentary hops presence that's not as bitter as most and seems a little weak for the style. The malt character is on the thin side as well. The after-taste is sweet. M: Crisp and smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. D: Tasty, goes down easy, not filling at all, decent kick, decent representation of style. It's certainly a poundable beer, but that's mostly from what seems like a lack of substance.

{"label": 2, "text": "New Great Lakes seasonal, I think this is the best newer offering they've had recently. Live review from the bottle, but I have also had this on tap. (Actually did a side by side between this and Celebrator.) Pours with excellent clarity, a robust dark hardwood grain color. The head can be easily controlled with this beer. If you wish you can produce several fingers, I seem to prefer a more subdued pour after a half dozen of these this season. A tall pour seems to destroy much of the carbonation. With a clean glass I have been able to produce a true wall of lace which is quite exceptional. The smell is very warm and bready. Dark wheat and toasted grains. Lots of yeasty unbaked dough in there, as well as sweet fruits like fig and date. Compared to Celebrator this is not quite as sweet, and much more grainy. That said, it smells much more fresh to me, and very clean. Crisp and chewy malt goodness greets the palate. Doppelrock is full of flavor. Toasty bread crust and dark grains.There's plenty of sweetness, but much less than in some versions of the style. Great Lakes always does such a wonderful job of creating amazingly clean and fresh flavors. Chewy with soft, pillowy carbonation - quite nice, though maybe the carbonation is a tad low for the style. I like it this way. Overall I have really enjoyed this brew, and sincerely hope it makes its way back around next season. I wish it were cheaper, but it is easily several dollars under the Celebrator price point."}

The taste is appropriately matched by its smell. Not a lot of carbonation nor is it a real thick stout. It's almost milky. Doesn't have the hoppy bite I like though. If you love a stout then you'll probably jump on this one quick. Original taste, not too thick, creamy but doesn't skip out on its own bold masculine flavors. Not my style but I can see why others could love it."}

T: Spritzy and citrusy with a mild peppery and yeast finish. Baked bread qualities at the end as well. Easy to drink. D: I think I'm getting bored of Witbiers; I've had some many different variations, that they just seem to be a light, refreshing easy to drink beer, but nothing that really is overly memorable or stands out. This is not a indictment of this specific beer, just a personal opinion of the general style of witbiers. For the style, this one is right on par, however.

{"label": 1, "text": "A: Opened the bottle to absolutely no sound...poured into the glass hoping for at least some hint of carbonation, and was sadly disappointed. Pitch black with absolutely no head, quite a different look than what I recall from having it on tap at the Christmas in July event. I really have a hard time buying into the \"this is how it's supposed to be\" line that we've been fed. S: Bourbon up front, followed up by more bourbon. I love bourbon, both on its own and integrated with imperial stouts, but this is really over the top. Hints of chocolate and roasted malts are lurking but this really lost a lot of the complexity of the normal SLH. Again, perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me, but I remember a more balanced aroma on tap. T: Bourbon heavy up front but it really balances out on the backend into a blend of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a general roastiness. I like the general flavor profile but it's definitely not as well integrated as it should be. M: A bit more drinkable than I was expecting based upon the lack of carbonation, but it's definitely not what it should be. Fairly smooth but even a few bubbles would've made a huge difference here. D: A tasty brew but between the lack of carbonation and the bourbon not having mellowed, making it through a bomber wasn't easy. On tap, it went down way too easy. Overall, this is a tremendous disappointment, as the memory of its quality on-tap is still fresh enough to remind of what this really should be. I've still got several bottles and I'm hoping the bourbon at least mellows a bit to yield the exceptional taste I know is possible."}

Drinkability Nothing here makes this beer undrinkable. In fact it's pretty unremarkable because of it. It's pretty reserved in all the categories.

In the aroma, a trace of mildly sweet pale malt is joined by an indistinct adjunct note. Hops are steely, peppery, and short lived. Upon tasting, the pale malt is moderately sweet, but a canned corn presence sours things slightly. The hops are more generally spicy here, metallic, and mildly skunky. A yeasty doughiness and distant residual grain sweetness are crisped away by a finish that bitters in a shallow way, then drops off promptly. It's light, which is the one real asset. Light bodied, it flows, disappears, and leaves almost no trace. It comes from my homeland, but the truth is, I kind of wish it stayed there. It's thin, with little true character, and it seems to be the equivalent of a Lithuanian macro. It is drinkable? Well, sure, you could say that, but so is brackish water, in a pinch.

I purchased this growler last night at Capone's saison event (though obviously this isn't a saison) and am drinking it tonight on a lazy Friday evening. It pours into my Hopback Amber weizen glass a hazy, pale straw gold, though still a few shades darker than macro-lager color. The head is huge and rocky and initially forms a 2-finger high froth. Eventually it shrinks to a nearly full cap going no further. The nose presents an acidic tartness coupled with some major citrus (lemon especially). A sweet malt base is a little tricky to pick out, but it's there. Some light floral notes lurk as well, hinting at some herbal additions perhaps. The first thing that strikes me is the complete dryness of the beer. The body is light with a lower carbonation (surely from repeated fillings and pourings). Tartness is quite prevalent, particularly in the finish, with backup notes of lemon, flowers, and a candy sweetness. Each sip gets me coming back for another, forming an endless cycle. What a beer for a summer day. But I think the smartest thing I did was choose a 3.1% beer to get a whole half-gallon of. This should be gone in no time."}

The metal is hefty- I'd guess that any big brewer who uses it would seek to skinny it down to cut costs. If the cost is not too prohibitive, craft beers could be well served in this type container. As to Iron- hey, no particular aroma, inoffensive, drinkable. Not much to write home about. The bartender where I picked it up said the package has helped renew local interest.

Initial blast of dried apricot blows off to reveal classic Cantillon. Sour citrus leads the way as always, but here it is well-supported by a subtle earth and apricot. Bready malt pokes through as does a bit of barnyard, which increases with time. Simply a stunning nose, even for Cantillon. First few sips are over-whelmed by the Cantillon acidity, even for this veteran Cantillon devotee. Eventually, my mouth adjusts and the true palate begins to show. Acidic citrus still dominates, but there is some maltiness in there as well. A metallic note is present throughout and a bit distracting. The apricot is just an afterthought on the palate. Finish is incredibly long with the acidity somehow managing to build after swallowing. Quite a ride! Mouthfeel is fine and soft.

(5) T - The sour cherry is prevalent with a tart edge. The pungency is not prevalent as it is in the scent. This is a superb tasting fruit brew. (5) M - The feel is wet and slightly coarse. I almost wish it was a bit softer as a wine would be. Nonetheless, it goes down well. (4) ~ Easy to drink. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, desert. This is a beer that has stood and I imagine will continue to be on the brew calendar for the folks in Southern Wisconsin. (4.5)"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Light bodied, Light apricot color, cloudy, with a huge white fluffy head. Aroma is mainly lemon and fresh bread, no detectable bananas or cloves - not all bad. Taste is mainly lemon, yeast/bread, with a little fruitiness more like apple or pear. Finishes tart with a touch of hops. crisp and refreshing but a little different than the usual hefe-weizen."}

Nose is a blast of citrusy hops, mmmm. Taste is somewhat malty but finishes near perfectly with a whopping amount of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth for the style. Overall drinkability is very good despite the high abv. This is a very good representation of style and it compares quite well to the other San Diego hop peddlers high IBU brews."}

S- the smell is very mild. caramel malts and grassy hops. not really what i was expecting.

{"label": 1, "text": "Picked up at a gas station in southern Bavaria, not far from the brewery. The standard brown half liter bottle features a gold, black and white label featuring a grenadier having a flag bearing the name of the brewery. Purity law applies. Best before 7/13/07, I opened it on 5/6/07. Pours a clear yet quite bubbly deep gold under a one finger white head that fades rather quickly, leaving just a bit of film but no lace. Very little nose, with just a hint grain. The mouth is slightly sticky and very prickly. Mild sweet grain opening, chased quickly by a slightly harsh metallic bitter bite. The grain fades quickly, leaving the entire taste field to the bitter, which does have a slight spicey tone. The bitter lasts a very long time, mellowing as it ages to a quite pleasant sensation. Can't say I'm thrilled with this brew, as there are so many better in the world."}

I feel this brew is not as hoppy as it should be. Maybe it sat on the shelf for too long, who knows. Anywho, I'm a bit let down with this one and I'm starting to get a negative connotaion towards Alesmith for charging so much and not delivering. Light to medium body with decent malts and hops. With heaps of AIPA out on the market this is one I will gladly pass up (unless I can find out exactly how fresh it is)."}

S: The nose is pretty inviting. The typical Saison aromas are there with notes of lemon zest and fruity esters along with a passion fruit sweetness. T: Wow this thing is pretty sweet but it works. The fruit juices are at the forefront with a nice sweetness which is followed by the clove and esters from the Saison yeast. M: The feel is medium bodied and only slightly drying on the finish. O: The was tasty and an interesting take on a Saison. Definitely not traditional but I appreciate what they did here. I'd drink it again for sure...I may grab another and lay it down for a while to see how it develops."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bright, pale gold, slight haze, big rocky white head. Bold and malty sweet nose. Fruity with spicy alcohol as well. Heavy golden maltiness that is fairly creamy and smooth, but not overly sweet. A small amount of fermented honey sweetness comes through along with lemons and apples peeking in along the edges. Fairly heavy spiciness and alcohol slowly fade away after this one goes down. Now this was to be my first of the style which I thought a Belgian IPA, not a BSPA. Maybe it is mislabeled. As a BSPA it is unspectacular. It isn't overly complex, but is heavy, malty, spicy, and alcoholic; which probably ranks it as one of the best pirate grog's available. yargh."}

There is a mild hop bitterness that follows the strong malt flavors, which helps to balance the overal beer. (The aroma and maltiness becomes even stronger as this beer wramed in my glass).

Complex sweet flavors leap forward, only to be surpasses by a delectable dry nuttiness. The bitterness of the hops creates a tremendous balance. Notes: This is one of my favorite nut brown ales. I had it first at BLT Steak in NYC with a filet mignon served with bernaise sauce. The trifecta of flavors was perfect."}

There's a little bit of an astringent taste in there though. Mouthfeel is pretty standard, a rush of foam then clear bubbly beer. Drinkability - not worth the price, but a good brew. Would buy more if it were half the cost."}

{"label": 1, "text": "This pours out into my Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip a glopping, robust black, upon which I am required to force-pour a very thin head. Like a couple of other serious Imperial Stouts, this one just doesn't want to hold a head, though the brown-brown-brown ring that remains leaves behind spots of lacing. This has a dark, roasty malt smell that carries scents that I am positive have been imparted by the oak aging - a kind of astringent vanilla. It's robust, for sure. The taste definitely carries characteristics of oak aging, and I wish now that I had bought the original Yeti to compare the two. The taste begins very, very smooth, with a vanilla-bean maltiness, then transitions to a hard-hitting astringent, alcoholic malt and hop profile that kicks with a brief, Cascade-like bitterness. Smooth, thick mouthfeel that packs an alcoholic warming punch - I recommend letting it warm as you sip. Carbonation is minimal, but the alcohol bites a little harder than I'd like, and makes the mouthfeel a little too harsh for something thick. This beer packs a serious punch, heavy, complex, and aggressive, despite - or perhaps due to - the aok cask aging. I fully intend to try the original Yeti."}

Some malt in there, traces of wheat. All in all a little too fruity for me. I'm not a huge fruit beer fan to begin with, this was a little much for me. Probably enjoyable if it's your thing, but it was a little too fruity and not nearly \"beery\" enough for my tastes. Somebody else mentioned that this fits well in a Samuel Adams variety pack- I'd agree with that."}

S-- Candied orange, candied grapefruit, passion fruit, and pineapple. Really nice smell and a larger candied grapefruit smell once it warms up. T-- Bitter grapefruit taste with touches of bitter orange. Not a lot of pine though. Mostly about fruit and more fruit. Slightly pungent tasting. M-- Medium carbonation and nearly heavy feel. Lots of pungent, bitter grapefruit and bitter grapefruit and just touches of syrupy Carmel malt. Mouth is more about bitter fruits as the nose is more about crisp fruits.

{"label": 2, "text": "Bottle into pint glass A- Once poured this beer exploded. A GIANT head filled the top fifth of the glass and after a minute still was a two finger head. Its color is a dark brown becoming lighter in color and more translucent as it lowers down the glass. Lacing was really nice as it sunk. S- Not an incredibly strong nose but a light malt with some fruit and almond or toffee. T- Lots of upfront malt with a silky finish that shows off its 8.5 abv yet has enough hops to balance that abv down to smooth. Still slides down nicely and leaves little behind. Some dark fruit and malt dominates this but the creaminess of the caramel or toffee.. whatever I can't peg lends this an even easier drinking brew. F- medium to heavy mouthfeel. Thickens as it drinks yet fades just as quick after the swallow. The alcohol, although not overwhelming, is surely an open participant in the discussion but I think the higher IBU's makes this a nice marriage. D- I typically like if not love most things that come from Founders and this is no exception. A great example of a well balanced and interesting Scotch Style Ale that may not be an all night drinker but sliding one in when you can is a good idea. RESPECT"}
{"label": 2, "text": "I pick up this beer while on vacation over turkey day. I have always wondered how a wet hop brew vs a dry hop taste. I know that Sierra Nevada has always gone big and never went home. I poured into a pint glass at 43 degrees. Appearance: A monster ivory two finger head that has some retention to it. As the head slowly dissipates it leaves lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is medium amber color with orange hues. There are a lot of carbonation bubbles in the beer and the clarity is clear to brilliant. Nose: Grapefruit, pine and floral ester hit your nose first. The malt in the beer has notes of bread with a subtle sweetness. Taste: A very ripe grapefruit, pine, and floral esters. The malt is very sturdy with phenol notes. Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is astringent, clean, and rich. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. I am a bit disappointment in this beer, thier pale ale is really a up in your face; although, this beer is a very good IPA."}

But the mixture is not the beat combination. The taste starts very sweet of strawberry and then switches to malty sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is very fizzy and kind of dry... Almost soda-like. Overall and interesting beer and worth a try sometime if you don't have to buy the entire bottle."}
{"label": 1, "text": "This is actually my first stout so I have nothing to compare it to. Im going to try to review it just on its features and not compare it to any other type of beer Ive had. A- It poured a dark brown. Almost black. There was just a trace of a head but interestingly there were balls of liquid that would bounce around on the surface for a bit before falling into the beer. It was quite interesting. S- It smelled very rich. My fairly untrained nose and palate could depict the chocolate and the malt easily. T- Being that this is my first stout I cant be sure if this is the norm, but the flavors were so complex and satisfying. It has an almost sweet taste at first that was followed by a slight bite. I can really taste the chocolate and maybe even a little coffee. M- I am not a fan of too much carbonation so this fit the bill very well. Just a slight amount of bubbles that helps carry down this silky smooth elixir. Much better mouthfeel than most Ive tried thus far (though again may be the style that Im not used to). All in all, this is a very worthy beer and I will be trying many more stouts in the near future."}

I'm finding the lagers a little lacking in structure, but this ale brightens my hopes that good things are yet to come. Pours a bright amber, very clear and perhaps a little brassy in sunlight. It hold its head up one inch, and subsides gradually down to some fine lacings. The nose is not quite the American Pale I've had of late...not quite as citrusy as we colonials are wont to give our brews. The Burning River smells more floral and brightly sweet...I'm thinking more of rose petal, geranium, lavender, and apple blossom. Smooth caramel sweetness with a touch of candy sugar, or rock candy. But finishes with a pine-y resin which is quite a stunner. Fine acidity and a touch of pleasant astringency in the aftertaste makes me want to grab another.

Well, I finally got it and I wasn't all that impressed. I beautiful appearance and crisp, clean smell waters the mouth but only for slight disappointment. Don't get it twisted, this is a good beer, but it loses for me on the terms of being a summer selection. Few breweries master the summer seasonal, as it seems that most just offer a watered down selection of their flagship brew - and Sierra Nevada nearly falls into that category. It falls short in taste while simultaneously lacking in the \"refreshment\" category, and that for me is a big no-no. If you sacrifice one, you better compensate in the other. Good beer, descent summer seasonal."}

This brewery has impressed me twice thus far."}
{"label": 2, "text": "I saw some potential in their Imperial Lager, I figured the Stout would prove solid. The beer pours an expected rich dark-brown hue, and an unexpected dense, viscous texture. The foamstand rises to an inch and remains firm through the session. Solid aromas of roasted barley, toast, rich coffee, and cocoa swirl around a mild fermented lactose sweet scent. Flavors closely follow those found in the aroma and remain bold and clean without ever waivering. The beer has no single character that rises above the rest, relying on balance and maturity to produce high quality. Full and rich to the mouth, without becomming thick or chewy. Finishes sweet and with a solid roasted barley flavor (not charcoal). It's difficult to find a more solidly brewed Stout, however it's lack of challenging character leaves me wanting more."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured a cloudy, light copper with a medium, frothy white head. Decent retention with nice lacings. Orange peel, grapefruit, pine and an explosion of hops make the sweet aromas come to life. Sweet citrus taste that quickly mingles with a barrage of hops. Simcoe hops seem to be the predominant taste but there are more flavors to be savored. My one gripe is that the hoppiness is rather untamed. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love hops but there just doesn't seem to be a smooth, consistent taste here. One taste is exceptional and the next taste is so-so. The aftertaste is bitter, dry with fruity notes. A nice, fizzy mouthfeel makes this a pleasure on the palate. Though, drinkability is somewhat challenged by the unbalanced flavor. There are some great flavors going on this beer. I think that with a little control it could become one of the better IPAs on the market."}

Taste: Some buttery notes upfront with some grassy notes middle and back. Caramel and golden raisins, with some hops pepper, orange and honey. Light, with exceptional masking of the booze. Mouthfeel: Low creamy carbonation nonetheless reveals a slightly thin body, without enough characteristic sweetness to the malt. Easy enough to drink, with a bready finish. Drinkability: Good; solid with in the style and easy to put away. THe first time I had this it seemed very bitter with too much cocoa, while this time the diacetyl notes were a little distracting. Good for a regularly available beer, but a little thin and underdeveloped for the style."}

Sign of things to come. Taste is great. Exactly what I want from an IPA. Prominent hoppiness with more of the mix of citrus, floral, and pine. Balanced out with the malt just perfectly. Mouthfeel is a little stick. Just about right. Nice carbonation. Pretty drinkable. The ABV is noticed only at the end. Balance makes this much more drinkable than many other IPAs I have tried.

Can anyone else relate to that? It left my wouth too dry to want another one. My friend who goes to school in Vermont raves about this beer so I had to see what all the fuss was about.

Little bubbles drift, appearing like flakes of salt. The aroma is a little herbal, a little floral, but mostly malty. The hopping is evident, but not pronounced. Troegs make things quite clear from here - this will be malty. A crisp, snappy bitterness which, along with how hefty and filling the body is, makes this incredible quenching. So damn refreshing! Flavour of drying, slightly sweet malts with a hint of lightly grassy hops. This is textbook pils. It is also ideal pils. If only the masses could try this they might experience the aroma, the flavour, and most of all the refreshment a true pilsner is capable of. It would seem that some of the American craft brewers are mastering the art of the pilsner - Troegs is certainly one of them."}

It doesnt really have anything to set it apart from other barrel-aged imperials Ive had, but theyre all pretty good, arent they? Not so big bodied, lets call it medium bodied and carbonation is restrained.

{"label": 2, "text": "Interesting Belgian style IPA, kind of the best of both worlds. My 2 favorite types of beers rolled into one. At first I wasn't sure about this one but I find myself going back to it time and time again. The appearance is a lovely golden copper with a good 2 fingers of foam. Nice even lacing along the sides of my Duvel tulip. The smell is outstanding, very inviting somewhat pungeant floral and fermentation that you get with those awesome belgians, it has that. The taste is very unique and enjoyable, sort of that belgian malt/yeast thing at the front end, then an instant bitter hoppiness as it washer down the back side. very nice! Feels somewhat heavy, sweet but tasty. One of my favorites, probably not a good summer beer but in this crappy Minnesota weather just a couple of these at over 8%abv and you become warm very quickly!"}

Nothing special about the way this beer looks. Not a lot of foam, but nice sticky lacing. S - Piney hops bouquet and sweet malt. From its smell I might could be prepared for a DIPA or harvest ale. T - Bright intensely hoppy. Very good IPA hops flavor with malt holding its own in the background. Malt flavor is not complex. Very bitter as it should be. As it warms the malt comes out more but the beer remains dry true to the California style. M - Medium bodied D - Fits its intended purpose and definitely meets my expectations."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured a hazy orange with a thin frothy white head that subsided quickly. The aroma is lemony with a bit of a wheat like character blended in with dry malts. The aroma lacks any of the Belgian frutiness from the esters and I think it should have some esters as it seems more like an American Hefe than a Belgian seasonal specialty. The flavor was pretty good with as nice spicy lemony flavor blended in with a dry wheat and malt flavor. Finishes with a yeasty taste that reminds me of drinking green beer. The oats are noticeable in the finish as it has more body than a wheat beer but tha lack in head retention makes it kind of noticeable that care was not taken during the brewing process. Probably a great beer to have on a hot day at the beach or while mowing the lawn."}

Tastes very much like a fruit-based alcohol."}

I am not unfortunately. The beer itself is also rather dry. M - The carbonation is good and fits the taste. A little bitter finish.

A hint of bitterness shows up followed by lingering sweetness that gets a bit cloying. I felt the mouthfeel was a bit thin and oily. Overall, I really didn't like this beer. It seemed to have a bit of Belgiany-ness but not much. It may be a good gateway to Belgian beers."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Appearance: The pour is a slightly hazy fiery amber with a white head the quickly descends to a ring and a small island in the middle of the beer. Smell: This has a shockingly faint aroma. If I try hard enough, I can pick up an earthy character, fresh cut grass, pine, spicy hops, and caramel malts. Taste: This is not good. The beer is fairly hoppy, but the hop profile is downright lousy. Right away I get a vegetal, musty, and earthy character. Pine and grass come out in a futile attempt to save the beer in the midpalate, but all is lost when the musty flavor comes back, bringing booze and a sourness with it, for the finish. Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied with plenty of carbonation, but I have to knock it for its rough finish. Drinkability: Last year's Butte Creek 2IPA was one of the only organic beers I've had that was tasty, this year's is a major pass. I'm not even going to finish the first pour."}

{"label": 2, "text": "On-tap at K Restaurant, Orlando A - Pours a beautiful deep gold, reminiscent of a Belgian strong pale. Lively head leaves a sufficient lacing on the sides of the glass. S - Earthy, grassy hops. Faint bready, biscuity sweetness rounds out the back, but this is overwhelmingly a hop-forward beer. The noble hops are very evident with the slightly dank, pungent bitterness very different from American varietals. T - Crisp hops greet the palate first. Citrus, grass, dank. Peppery and pleasantly spicy hop finish as expected from noble hops. Faint sugary sweetness on the back of the tongue prevents it from being over the top. A pretty good example of the style, compared to most imported Euro pils. M - This starts off great but gets noticeable prickly after having a few -- not terrible, but I'd prefer it to perhaps be SLIGHTLY toned back. Consistency is on point for the style. D - This is where this beer really shines! I could see myself drinking six of these at a barbeque or at the beach, no problem. The light character combined with the refreshing hoppiness would be great on a warm summer day. A worthy competitor to some of the more expensive imports, and available fresh nearly everywhere. For $7-8 a sixer, it's definitely worth serious consideration."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Six Pack Dan's Liquor Plover, Wisconsin Appearance - At first pour this beer is a very deep brown, almost black but not quite. Head is a pale brown that lasts along the wall of the pint glass but dwindles in a swirl towards it's center. Even with the rich color is still appears to be watery, which I like. It looks to be an easily drinkable beer. Smell - The scent is very faint. It takes several strong whiffs to be able to really recognize a discernable aroma. The scent is a pleasant roasted flavor but not as strong as I'd like. Taste - The Black Lager does a good job of maintaining the qualities found in a lager beer. It's a smooth tasting beer that adds a roasted roundness that I've discovered, I enjoy. Mouthfeel - The beer is a bit uncomfortable on the tongue when not imediately swallowed. The carbonation kicks in stronger here than most dark beers. I guess that's just the Lager side talkin'. ~ I would order another Samuel Adams - Black Lager. This is a beer that's easy to drink with it's watery finish. I'd really like to give this a try from a tap. Anyone know where I can get a Black Lager on tap?"}
{"label": 2, "text": "I was so excited about finding that that I bought two bottles just on that general principle. The hype has been high, and though some Weyerbacher stuff I liked, much of it I didn't think was the most superb in each respective category. Insanity, however, is absolutely gorgeous in every way, and I may just buy out any bottles I can find of this stuff. 22 oz. bomber into a wine glass. Appearance: Nice white head that sticks pretty solidly to the top, foaming and slowly dissipating. A great mix of hazy amber, orange, and yellow colors, with bubbles sluggishly making their way to breathe at the beginning of the foam. Smell: Holy good God. Absolutely perfect and insanely complex. I'm just going to give a run down upon breathing it in: caramel, sugars, fruit, toffee, pineapple, plum, raisin, oak, vanilla, slight bourbon, slight rum, butter, frosting, slight yeast, bread and nuts. The complexity is interminable. I can't say enough. Taste: How could the taste come close to the aromas? I'm seriously asking myself that now. The vanilla flavors and woodiness are up front, sliding into a balance of tons of different fruit and malt qualities (in addition to a creamy sweetness akin to cake icing, which I've never encountered in a beer), and finally settling into the slightest and most subtle form of hop bitterness. The aftertaste is simply stellar also. I can't believe how amazing this is. Mouthfeel: Perfect again. Silky, smooth, creamy, The carbonation is medium to high, but somehow is perfect and settles down very well, going extremely well with the other qualities of the flavors, allowing them to blossom into the fullest potential. Drinkability: You'd simply be a fool to not savor this for as long as possible. If the ABV were lower this may be the beer that the gods would drink. Simply amazing. Thank you, Weyerbacher. If this somehow doesn't become a staple I'm going to be very sad. I may spend the rest of the money in my bank account now on getting bottles just to have them. I believe this is the staple all barley wines should be trying to match. Not only that, but from most of the barley wines I've tried, the \"greenness\" factor is a huge variable. But with this young guy, it doesn't even matter, and it's perfect now. That, to me, means that if this gets better as it gets older, I'm in for a very tangible and effulgent form of pure perfection."}

Absent of the astringent character I generally associate with an IPA smell. T - The first thing I notice is cleanliness - SA beers always have that crisp, 'spring water' taste and I notice it here even more than anywhere else. The hop flavor is well balanced and even with a clean finish, but the taste isn't very complex. MF/D - The bright flavor and easy finish make this one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, in terms of a \"session beer\" type of drinkability. For an IPA, I'm not so sure this is a good thing. I think this is a really fun idea and a good beer. It's not a great beer, but I'm really interested to see them try to grapple with the idea of an Estate beer. I would recommend this more for the idea and experience than the taste itself, which is interesting, and different, but not amazing."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Weyerbacher's Eleven really takes things up a notch! This brash and bold ale pours a mostly-clear (it's just so viscous that you could never really see your fingerprints through the glass), gold-orange-copper body beneath a massive head of frothy ivory lace. The head retention is excellent and it leaves walls of thick, craggy lace about the glass. The nose is surprisingly restrained for a self-proclaimed \"triple\" IPA; but there are some piney and gently citrusy/fruity/minty hops there; and to a certain extent, the huge head holds the aroma back by containing it. The head is beautiful though! In the mouth, an over-abundance of malt leaves it stunningly dextrinous and creamy (almost chewy!), but a zesty carbonation is able to liven the tongue and cut through its maltiness, keeping it from becoming sticky. The hops and alcohol hit you straight away at the first sip, but the pillowy soft, gently sweet, and mildly caramelish malt follows, softening the blow. The hops are pungent, softly piney, minty, sublimely fruity (or is that from the yeast?), leafy, and perhaps spicy - but that's hard to tell as a swish of alcohol enters fairly abruptly and never does get the hint to go home. After a few sips you'll start to feel the warming in your mouth, throat, and belly; and not far beyond that your palate will become dulled. The bitterness is rock solid, but not abrasive, and the huge maltiness balances nicely. Where are the hops though? You just can't pick them out in the mix. Nor can you really taste the malt, for that matter. The bitterness, hop acidity, and alcohol are always present though. It's just muddled... As it warms, however, it becomes much clearer and far more enjoyable. The alcohol is still there proclaiming it's strength at every opportunity, but the malt and hop flavors start to balance and make sense. If you view this as a super-strong English-style IPA it makes far more sense than what you might expect from an American double-IPA. And, I think, at cellar temperature, I'd quite enjoy a half-pint of this after one of two \"regulars\". Overall impression: an over the top beer that's been fired so high into the sky that it's lost touch with earth. Massive and bold, but somehow lacking finesse."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Wow, this is strong as hell. Pours a nice red color with a massive head that laces all the way down the glass. Smells of mega hops and is very malty as well. It is a little unbalanced toward the hoppy side, but that is the style. Tough to drink more than one of these as the alcohol shines through, hard! Finishes dry and makes you want to drink more, but just too much for me. It's like every beer you've ever had dumped into one. But a good beer, nonetheless."}

The smell is instant pine followed by a sharp scent of freshly baked bread. You can just tell that this boy is going to be hop-oriented. The taste is full of an intricate variety of hops. The malts take a back seat but can be noticed as the beer warms. There isn't much sweetness in this brew. The toasty, biscuity malts poke through but not the least bit of sweetness comes through. I enjoyed this beer with some sharp cheddar cheese. In your mouth, this beer feels a bit like it is biting you (in a good way).

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass, about 40 degrees fahrenheit. Pours a hazy gold with a light orange core. A frothy, white whipped cream head disappears into a rim of bubbles, no cap. Smells of clove, banana, and breads. Fairly projected. The mouth is relatively weak with a sort of cheap wheat flavor turning only into some banana at the start of the drydown. Barely any finish at all. What's there in it is largely yeast. High drinkability though, and with food maybe could see some additional character. Mouthfeel is thin, and more effervescent than I would like. More than feels like a \"Hefe-light.\" I think this is my least favorite offering from Flying Dog. Tame and safe, it doesn't really live up to the bold marketing set out for it. It accomplishes what it set out to do in terms of a German style Hefeweizen, but I would love a little bit more cream in the mouthfeel, maybe some additional viscosity. Anything to make it more tenacious. At $1.50USD (12oz bottle), I'm not disappointed, but given the variety of Hefeweizens on the market, I'll keep looking for sure. 82."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. Bottle says it is best by 4/24/2011, so freshness should not be an issue. Appearance: rich amber hue with an extremely clear body and two fingers of pillowy ivory foam. It's not bad, but I'd like to see a little haze here. I'm guessing based on the clarity that this beer is not bottle-conditioned. Smell: aroma is biscuity and clovey without much of the dark fruit type aromas I love so much in a dubbel. I'm saddened that this simply does not do it for me -- a trait shared by not a few New Belgium beers it seems. Taste: more of the same profile as in the aroma. It seems well-crafted, and isn't \"bad\", per se, but the direction the brewers decided to go here does not float my boat. Again, it is lacking in a lot of the complex and enjoyable fruity malt flavors that so many made-in-Belgium dubbels display. Mouthfeel: an appropriate level of cabonation combines with a medium body to create, actually, a very good creaminess. Mouthfeel is my favorite part of this beer, hands down. Drinkability: if you like the flavor, then this beer is entirely drinkable, especially considering its ABV. Feeling as I do about it, though, I have to just call it average."}

Unfortunately that same bandaid note overlays the rest of the flavors, and that is one of the few flavors I really dislike in a beer. I don't knowif that i a normal note or a contamination in this case, but regardless, this is not an ancient beer and was handled well, so I'm docking points here. Mouthfeel is quite effervescent and crisp- but maybe a touch too fizzy. Could be a good beer, but my experience was marred by the off-tastes."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Thanks to ThomasHardy for the bottle. This was a very nice treat, Brady. Apple Ale pours a crystal clear copper color. For some reason I was expecting some haze. Perhaps apple cider has clouded my vision. A foamy white head rises and falls quickly. It reached a finger or so deep, but active carbonation consumed it quickly. Lacing was sparse. One whiff is all it takes to be immersed in an apple wonderland. If you're a fan of apples at all, you'll be into this beer in a big way. It smells sweet and is very reminiscent of apple cider. It has a nice sweet aroma. There's a hint of light caramel malt sweetness, but that's about the only other scent I'm picking up. Apple dominates the nose. It smells delicious, but is a little limited in its range. The flavor doesn't differ materially from the nose. This is tasty stuff. An avalanche of apple sweetness takes over the palate and doesn't give much way. It's not an overly sweet apple flavor. It is very reminiscent of a nice cider. But, not in the alcohol infused cider beverage sense. I mean real apple cider. This is good stuff. There's a little bit of caramel malt that's noted. But, not much else. Once again, it's range is limited in terms of depth. But, I really like the flavor quite a bit. Easily one of the best fruit/vegetable beers I've encountered. It has a nice body that's on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is active, but is smooth and easy drinking. Impressive in terms of feel. Drinkability is okay, but a little limited. I like the flavor and it certainly goes down fast and easy, but I can easily see it growing a little tiresome if more than a single bottle were ahead of me. Not bad all the same. Apple Ale's a hell of a nice surprise. I tend to be hard on fruit/vegetable beer, but this is a rare exception that's a good, solid beer. Yeah, it's not exactly deep or complicated and it doesn't have a wealth of beer-like qualities. But, Apple Ale is a very nice change of pace beer that has a hell of a unique, enjoyable flavor. Take it for what it is and enjoy it. Oh, and if you like apples, you simply must find a few bottles."}

Rings of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma consists of roasted malt, milk chocolate, and hay. Had to search a little to find the roasted malt. The flavor is not that porterish. Sweeter than what I was expecting. The score I gave it is more than generous. The flavor is a combination of chocolate, cherries, and a herbal quality I cannot place. Maybe this bottle is off. Medium body and good carbonation. Has life without being harsh. Nice texture. The flavor just does not suit me. I will need another example and come back and judge this beer again because I cannot believe this is the best of the American Porters. 05/09/2010 Review Revisted this beer since it is brand new to the market. Best before date of 10/05/2010. I will bump up the taste score from 3 to 3.5 but otherwise my original ratings stand. The score increase is because this time I picked up more subtle flavors.

{"label": 2, "text": "Picked up a bottle on site - extremely fresh, only bottled three days ago! - poured into a lager glass. A nice amber lager, medium golden, lots of visible carbonation. Terrific lacing, an incredibly sturdy head that survived the entire pint. Smell was very subtle: bread, biscuits, a bit of fruit (apple), and of course the hops. A touch of yeast character to the nose as well. A lovely bitter lager, very full-flavoured and satisfying. Nice juicy, fruity hops with a bit of bread for a base. The finish is long and bitter, lasting for quite a while. Nicely carbonated, really sticks to your mouth. Tastes fresh and well crafted. \"Drink twice, review once\" might become a mantra for me now. Maybe it was the mood or the condition of the keg/lines the first time around, but the second, bottle tasting was terrific! One of the best APL's I've had outside of the states. Another win for Grand River!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "I drank this from a growler into a chalice. It pours a very dark orange with a big white. There is great lacing and it is surprisngly clear for its darkness of color. The aroma is nice and subtle. Orange zest hits on the front end but the hops are present. The tatse is complex with a nice sweet start, hops are present always and really show them self on the end. Its a nice bitter finish but not to bitter so it allows for big swigs and heavy drinking. The feel is great, lasts several seconds, the hops stay even after you swallow. Is it drinkable? Hell yeah, crushed a growler with my girlfriend in about an hour. This is great IPA, slightly higher in my book than PtE."}
{"label": 1, "text": "It pours a chestnut brown, clear and rather listless, really. A finger of beige head settles promptly to mere frothy vestiges. Lacing is sparse and uneventful. The aroma is chiefly malt, roasted and malty, along with black cherry and prunes. Ginger, more of gingerbread than the root, and a citrus touch of orange come about as advertised. Upon tasting, the credibly sweet malt swings the biggest bat, impressing as fruity and nutty, and bringing along general dark fruits and toffee. The orange is less notable here, and the ginger takes on a more floral image, a less compatible version than in the aroma. The finish is citrus-zest bitter and dry, lingering shortly. It's different, with a tasty note or two, but it's not enticing or edgy. Medium bodied, the malt lays softly on the palate, but the lack of carbonation lends a flat feel to the legacy. This beer seems to want to be more than it is, but when all's said and done, it's an above average, averagely spiced warmer that suffers from a lack of above-and-beyond TLC. Perhaps some vanilla creaminess or winter spice melange might have given it some real life, but as it is, the lasting image is one almost of ennui. It goes down well enough, but I turned off the Jets-Dolphins game for the same reason I won't likely drink this beer again: it's not painfully so, but rather fairly boring."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A moderately aggressive pour from a 2010/11 550ml bottle into my pint glass produced a manageable 2+ fingers of multi-density tan head. Head had good retention and leaves plenty of sticky lace on the sides of the glass. Nearly opaque, this cloudy brew is a very dark brown. The aroma is quite earthy and rather hoppy, with notes of caramel, citrus and vanilla. T - This is a rich and complex brew, as is should be given that it is a winter seasonal made with 15 ingredients. The most noticeable characteristics are the very earthy richness, a complex hop component (derived from Newport, Horizon, Simcoe, Centennial, Amarillo, Crystal 90 and Rogue Willamette varieties), and a strong toasted malt flavor. IBU = 68. Great hop/malt balance. Mouthfeel - perfectly carbonated. Carbonation and hops impart some crispness. Full bodied. Approaches a semi-dry finish. O - Hops are more evident in the aroma than the taste, where the rich malt flavor dominates without masking the hop component. Mogul Madness is a smooth and delicious brew you can think of as either a winter warmer or a brown PA. In any case very flavorful and interesting without being challenging. Highly recommended year around."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Poured probably 55 degrees Fahrenheit into a Tom Collins. No born date. Pours a muddled orange with yellow rims. Comes with a one finger white head that dissipates into a thin ring. No lacing. Smells of sweaty metal. A hint of wheat in there, not really all that appealing though. Taste is pleasantly surprising after the nose. A soft and pillowy mouthfeel supports a citrus character unseen in typical Blue Moons, if still not exactly there in force. Teritary hints of coriander and Belgian yeast poke through. Enjoyable though, if rather trite. Overall, I think this gets much closer to a real Belgian style, compared to what Coors typically calls a \"Belgian.\" I want to hate this just because it absolutely isn't enough to be called a \"Grand Cru,\" and isn't that flavorful in general. If standard Blue Moon Belgian was more like this, I would be a lot happier with them. Something about it for me personally though, is just really appealing. The softly pillowy mouthfeel, the higher sugar content. It feels mass produced, and probably is, but it's inoffensively populist and despite this, I really did enjoy it, as soon as I could curb my beer snobbery and start to see it as something really sort of unique. That being said, I definitely will not be spending $8 USD for another bomber of this. 84."}

The beer poured a lovely orange color with a pale orange cap of head that diminished somewhat slowly but left no cap/ring/or lacing. Smell was typical, with a little bit of mintiness to it and a mixture of some different types of hops. A nice citrusy backdrop for the beer. However, the smell of alcohol permeated the beer and kind of diminshed from the overall aroma. Flavor was good, up until the finish. I don't know if I've been in North Carolina too long, but the alcoholic finish detracted from the overall flavor. A touch disappointing. A good sweet caramel beginning to the beer which moved to a citrusy, somewhat bitter finish that was then dominated by the burn of ethanol. Allowing the beer to warm helped mix the alcohol flavor in and mute it some, but it still dominated and detacted. Body was sticky and solid but became more loose as it warmed. Overall, I was a touch disappointed by the brew, but only because it seemed unbalanced and over-the-top with the alcohol."}

The first thing I tasted was a heavy floral hop presence; almost like rose petals or something. At the end there is some Belgian yeast flavor but pretty restrained and not as much as I was expecting. There is also a little bit of alcohol taste as well. The mouthfeel seems just a little slick. This is my second example of the style and with a name like 'Raging Bitch' I was expecting something to hit me in the face.

{"label": 1, "text": "This beer, called a \"bitter\" on the menu and 4.8% ABV, really seems to be an American Pale Ale. Regardless, it is rather thin, one-dimensional, and out of balance. I had it at Bear Republic on 3 May 09. Amber, it has a medium off-white head, crweamy and slowly shrinking to a ring and wisps, leaving some nice lace. The aroma is toasted grain, grapefruit, and a little lemon. The taste is bitter grapefruit up front and all the way through the finish and lingering bitter aftertaste. It has a little toasted grain and hint of raisin, with the faintest hint of pine needle in the finish, but otherwise is just grapefruit. It is far too bitter for the thin, characterless, watery malt, with almost no sweetness or flavour to balance the bitterness, which lingers. Although not bitter in an absolute sense, this is one beer that is far too bitter relative to the rest of its elements and is totally unbalanced. It is a bit reminiscent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but the latter is a little better when on tap, fuller in feel and flavour."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Got this at Tower on Piedmont in Atlanta. Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a 1.5 finger off-white head. The head sticks around a bit before dissipating into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a medium-sized ring around the glass. Lacing is pretty sticky. Smells good. At first the biggest aroma is the pine, and backed by the sweet malt. As it warms the sweet malt moves to the forefront, where it's joined by a citrus smell to go along with the pine aroma. Tastes good. Similar to the smell, there are big piney flavors up front that accompany the sweet malt. As it warms the pine taste decreases and there's more of a subtle grapefruit flavor that hides behind the malty sweetness. The bitterness sneaks up on me, but it grows as my tastebuds settle. Mouthfeel is good. It's got a good thickness and the carbonation is not too much nor too little. This beer does a good job of coating the mouth, and the finish is certainly not dry. Drinkability is good. All 24 oz. went down pretty quickly, and I could probably down another one of them honestly. However, as much as I could drink another one, I don't necessarily crave another one. Overall this was a solid brew. I'm hoping I can get my phalanges on the Chico Estate Harvest as I'd love to compare the two. Regardless, the Southern Hemisphere is definitely worth a shot."}

Probably not, but it will go perfect with some hamburgers and good conversation."}

Bitterness does fade into slight sweetness but does it have to take so long? M= Excellent, one of the better balanced mouthfeels. Not too thick, not too thin D= It's ok, once you get past the overpowering hops. If you're not a fan of strong hops, avoid this beer. I do agree with the comment about this being Budweiser with hops. If you want a great microbrew pale ale without huge amounts of hops, I recommend Dogfish Head amber ale or Fat Tire."}

Slightly bracing citrus (grapefruit and, when you catch some malt as well, OJ). Caramel malts, cooked brownies. Piney hops give way to... blah. I think maybe the spicing detracts from the malt flavors. Allspice? Mint. Sweet malt hovers in the background, caramel and brownie mix, crystalline sugar. Citrus notes come in. Hops and some spice remain on palate. I'm vaguely reminded of when I used to sweeten up brownie batter with maple syrup and eat the resultant brownies with OJ. Swear to God, it tasted good. I wish the malts had been more forceful. This is nice, hoppy winter beer, but not very well rounded. Especially with the 8% ABV, this creamy but fairly light-bodied beer does go down smooth and easy."}
{"label": 1, "text": "A slightly vigorous pour produces only enough head to cover the beer for a half second, what is there is a amber tinged tan color. The beer is a dark plum / dark amber color that shows a lightly hazy, cranberry red hue when held up to the light. At the first, the aroma is a nice mix between rich malt notes and oak aromatics. Deeper inspection yields much the same with competing aromas of ripe, bright, concentrated berry notes, some spicy bourbon, soft butterscotch, a touch of molasses, deeply caramelized malt, lightly toasted grain and browned biscuits. Somewhat sweet, though this beer drinks much richer than the sweetness would suggest. The body of this beer is downright chewy, viscous and mouth-coating. Flavors of berries, hugely caramelized grain and a rich malt character slowly yield to spicy, oak and Bourbon influenced flavors that linger on in the finish. The buttery notes from the oak and Bourbon character really shows through in the finish and it adds a nice compliment to the up front malt focus of this beer. Peppery oak and a bit of hot boozy Bourbon notes provides a sharpness, almost harshness as the beer warms up a bit. I really like that the malt character plays a slightly bigger role in the flavor profile than the bourbon barrel does; this keeps the integrity of the rich, Scotch ale style, but with an offsetting bourbon component that helps to offset / balance the thick malt character of this brew. Having said that, bourbon barrel aged beers seem to be a bit hard for me to get behind; there is something about the Bourbon notes that add a harshness the beers aged in the barrels that just doesn't quite work for me. As the beer warms up from its initial 50F / 10C it picks up more of the sharp, hot, Bourbon flavors which pull this away from being balanced. This is not a bad brew, but the Bourbon character is a bit much, especially as the beer warms up a bit."}

Aromas were full of ripe fruits, thick chewy malts, spices, some chocolate and plenty of teacle. Flavour was thickly layered malts, fruits and warming alcohol. Long aftertaste with some hops appearing to give a bitter edge, mouth coating sweetness lingers."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a clear sunny yellow brew. Smells very malty for a lager with some grain smells. Tangy for a lager. Slightly sweet and grainy and mild yeasty sour note. Assertive hops, but well balanced. The hops keeps coming back now and then giving my tongue a little slap to keep it fun to drink. Good Mouthfeel! Super drinkable, too bad it is a bit expensive."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured an average golden straw color with quite a bit of foamy white head on it. Smell is very faint, a bit of grain. Light honey taste, but mainly just a average beer flavor. Very smooth and easy to drink beer. Not much body to it, but a good light flavor. Not bad if the price is right."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Served in an English style pint glass from a typical Samuel Smith 550cc bottle. a: Bright gold to copper color with 1/2 inch of bright, fluffy head. Head retention isn't great, but about on par for style. s: Bready malt and light caramel dominate the nose. Although the label promises plenty of fresh hop character, very little is present in my bottle. There may be some floral notes, but I think the transatlantic voyage is really showing in this regard. The English yeast character is delightful, however, with plenty of apple/pear notes. t: Again dominated by caramel and bready malt flavors. Hop bitterness is present, though the balance is tipped towards the malt. Very little hop flavor. m: although the head retention is less than robust, and it is not heavily carbonated, this beer is full body, and a nice bubbly sensation in the mouth. Overall, the beer is good, but I suspect that the bottles I have access to are not treated will during shipment and storage at my local shops. I can't give points for what I expect the beer tastes like when the hop character is fresher, but I wish that I could. The malt character is brilliant, as is the mouthfeel, with some hops on the nose and a bit of hop character I could see falling in love with this beer."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a nice mild copper color with a one finger head. Aroma is hard to describe but smells of fresh hops, with a mild grassy/floral touch. Taste is very nice and hoppy upfront with a bold maltiness as well. There's a nice dryness towards the back of the throat and a subtle bitterness as well. Definitely a beautiful ale with the type of dryness that I look for in a beer."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A - Pours a deep dark brown color with some red hints on the edges with a half-finger of tan head. The head fairly quickly reduces to a ring around the edge of the glass. S - Aroma is full of sweet dark fruit (raisin and plum). There is also some spiciness and some booze mixed in as well. Little bit of carmel malt breaks through. T - Starts off with some deep dark fruit flavors, with lots of raison flavor. Also some booze flavor from the start. Little bit of carmel malt in the background. Through the middle there is some bitterness that breaks through more of the fruity flavors. The finish has a blend of the dark fruit flavors and some booze flavor and a touch of bitterness that lingers. M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. The booze is apparent all the way through the beer and overall fairly sharp, especially in the finish. D - Fairly drinkable. Definitely, a big sipping beer, but there is a lot to enjoy here. The booze flavor is a bit strong, but works alongside the other really big flavors. The hop mixed in is really excellent."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The bottle I have has an entirely different purple label than the one depicted here, and is called 'India Pale Ale', but, whatever... This beer pours a slightly hazy medium orange amber colour, with two fingers of foamy ecru head, which leaves some random swaths of lace around the glass as it falls away. It smells of sweet toffee malt, fruity citrus, and leafy hops. The taste is fruity, biscuity malt, and mild floral, citrusy hops. The carbonation is quite subdued, the body light, crisp, and lean. It finishes a bit off-dry, the bready sweetness countered somewhat by the earthy, leafy hops. Despite the ode to American influence on the label, what we got here is much more of an old world, British rendition of the style, if only a bit more pungent than the normal UK noble effort."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Had this one sitting in my DBF for well over a year now... about time I break it out for a review! Served from a 22oz. bomber in a big brandy snifter at cellar temperature. Will let it warm up a bit more before I complete the review, however. A - Pours like nice, unfiltered apple cider with a ruby cast, creating a dense, finely bubbled head -- light tan in color, and creamy. Also shows pockets of big soapy bubbles, swirling with rainbow color as if they were actually made of soap. The head dissapates over the course of a few minutes, but leaves behind islands of big bubbles. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass with each sip, and retreats ever so slowly back into the remaining liquid. S - Big, candy apple and vanilla. Seductive. Malty and sweet like a dessert. Creme brulee? Has a depth of character that contains many nuances that are hard to pinpoint. Can't get my nose out of the glass. T - Rather laid back upon entering the mouth... miscellaneous malt sweetness and a hint of vanilla. Once it hits the middle of the tongue, that's where the fun begins, and the oak comes through. Immediately following, there are yeasty notes and dark, sweet fruits. Lots of raisiny goodness. The swallow brings a hugely warming alcohol kick, and a nice dose of hoppiness for balance. M - Tingly, but restrained carbonation. Washes around the mouth pleasantly, becoming a froth. Initally a bit rough from the alcohol, but once it warms to somewhere around room temperature, the alcohol fades harmlessly into the background. D - A big beer from the boys who love to make big beers. Great scent, and a very nice taste profile. The oak aging adds an excellent depth and roundness that pumps up the scores. Would go great with a nice English Stilton Cheese. Don't drink a bomber of this by yourself unless you're intentionally trying to get plastered, or in need some some help falling asleep."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Bomber to tulip A: Very dark amber to light brown. Despite an aggressive pour, a small white head has barely arrived before it dissipates and leaves a small bubbly ring. S: Roasted to burnt aromas. Deeper pulls reveal sweet caramel and fruit. There's an interesting (and heavy) sugary sweetness on the nose. T: Super sweet kick immediately, more specifically caramel. Each sip ends in a fruity ester followed by sweet liqueur and ethanol. Flavors are overwhelmed by a pretty boozy flavor. M: Light carbonation and light body, leaving very little residue (which was welcome). D: I wasn't really in the mood for an boozy and sweet combination. A syrup-like flavor really takes over as the beer warms. I'm dying for a bit more balance in this beer!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "On draught at The Bier Stein in Eugene. Served in a Czechvar cervoise, New Belgium's Dandelion Ale is a hazy gold with a small white head that leaves scattered lace. Smell is moderate, honey and flowers, with light fusels. Taste is kind of generic strong blonde, with notes of grain, fusels and light banana and clove esters. Nothing particularly floral or herbal, or whatever one might expect to get from the dandelion, apparently it just provided the bitterness rather then hops? Mouthfeel is very creamy, but a bit heavy of a Belgian Blonde (even though listed as an American Blonde here, the esters don't fit that). Drinkability is average. Not very interesting, a little to strong and heavy, I expected a more uniquely flavored saison rather then a generic, strong dirty blonde!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Got this on trade from jwinship83 - thanks! A - Nice and black, medium brown foamy head that doesn't fade much and lastes throughout the session. The head also laces the glass evenly. I'm impressed. S - strong smokey bourbon smell T - right along with the smell, a smokey bourbon taste. Finishes dry and watery. M - Light and frothy - very unique. The carbonation this head sweeps the palate clean, also unique. D - A good sipper here, the bourbon taste isn't to overboard and there isn't a super strong alcohol taste. One would be enough for me. This one was pretty impressive, the appearance and mouthfeel really surprised me. I'm not to keen on a smokey/bourbon stout but this one I can handle."}
{"label": 0, "text": "12oz bottle bought at State Line Liquors (DE) for about $2.50. Bottled on date of 8/4/10 (I think), so this one isn't that fresh at about 5 months. Appearance: Slightly cloudy, orange or light amber color. Half an inch of head reduces to a thin white layer. Very little lacing that sticks around. Aroma: Very sweet. Solvent and boozy aromas of strong caramel, crystal malts are prominent. Sweet oranges and grapefruit are what I get from the hops. Smells like an American Strong Ale more than a DIPA. Taste: Boozy right off the bat. Flavorful but it doesn't hide the 10% ABV well. Very little perceived bitterness at the start, but this comes in a bit in the middle and end to temper the sweetness. The sweet booziness is the first thing you taste and the caramel flavor sticks around in the finish. The finish is sweet with a bit of citrus, but not enough for my preferences. Really too malty and not enough bitterness or fruity/citrusy hops. This might be a lot better if it were only 8 or 9% and a bit dryer. Mouthfeel: Low carbonation which doesn't hurt it. The caramel sweetness lingers which is not pleasant. Drinkability: I wouldn't be able to drink more than a snifter of this; I'm glad I'm splitting the 12oz bottle actually. It's not a terrible DIPA, but not something I will seek out again. If I see it on draft, I'd like to try it fresh(er)."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pint at C'Est What. Arrives a hazy golden, a couple shades darker than your average per style. Nose is HEAVY on the banana, hint of cloves and phenols and something herbal. Pretty sweet smelling. Nice though. Taste is too unbalanced for me - loads of banana, light bandaid phenols, spicy clove in the finish with a nice herbal coriander quality, lightly floral. On the sweet side of things, way too hefty of a body for the style, makes it seem even more muddled. A pint was enough for me, I wouldn't revisit. I know I'm in the majority but I enjoyed the previous incarnation better, more balanced and drinkable. Second try: At The Only, heavy on the cloves and banana with a decidedly medicinal (aspirin) and bandaid note in the finish which increases with time. Really not digging this offering."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Southern Tier Big Red Ale is an orange/red in color with a half inch, big bubbled, beige head that quickly fades to a collar. Caramel malt sweetness is the order of the day for aroma. The taste is ruled by sweet caramel, but there are some hops in the picture too. At the back of the tongue there's a bit of a surprise, the taste of orange. The mouth feel is medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is good considering the beer has an ABV of nearly 10, but it is well masked by the flavor. Bravo Southern Tier, an excellent red ale, well done."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A - Very dark with little tan colored head that actually leaves some lacing. Remained basically opaque with slight red highlights when a flashlight was shined through. S - Coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. Uh-oh. T - Strong roast malts, coffee, chocolate, caramel. Very slight presence of hops. I couldn't taste much of the alcohol I smelled, which is nice, but it leaves a nice alcohol warming in your chest. I like it. My only complaint was that it's flirting with being overly sweet. M - Wouldn't say chewy, but it's full bodied all right. Medium carbonation level is a nice compliment. D - Stops before going over the line with the sweetness, low alcohol flavor, this would be perfect for warming on a winter's night (we DO get like 5 of those here in Florida, FYI). I'm more of a fan of the hop forward ISes, but this is a nice sweeter version. I'd much rather drink this than DFH WWS or any other that are just trying too hard."}

S-Huge pineapple notes with some grapefruit, deep caramel and biscuity notes. T-Bitter pineapple upfront with a little bit of caramel, biscuit, and a bit of grapefruit bitterness on the finish. M-Very smooth feel with low to moderate carbonation and a medium body. D-Very tasty and juicy hop profile with a nice malt backing to balance things out."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This one is a super dark brown (almost black) porter with a small off white head that disappears as soon as you finish pouring it. The smell is similar to a mocha cappuccino. Its flavor starts off a little watery, then gets malty and finishes with hints of chocolate and coffee. Its mouth feel is a bit watery and is mildly carbonated. This one is worth checking out, but not as robust as I like my robust porters."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Slightly hazy orange body leaning more towards the red end of the spectrum. Majestic antique white head towers over measuring three full fingers. Recedes slowly into a meringue like cap, fantastic lacing left encompassing the glass. Captivating bouquet of hops greet the nose. Largely citrus, more specifically grapefruit, dominate though a complimentary piny aroma fits in well beside. Subtle spiciness and bready malt base is also observed. Though the hops are certainly the focal point the malt does its best to stand out. Low levels of nuttiness and grain play off the caramel malt to provide a solid backbone. Hop flavors are rather varied. The more juicy citric flavor hits initial, piny flavor picks up mid palate while the more floral flavors tend to linger on the tongue after each sip. Bitterness is assertive but pleasant. Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy. Medium bodied accompanied with crisp carbonation. Finish is rather dry. Celebration is definitely my favorite of the Sierra Nevada IPA offerings. Well rounded and above average in every area. Drinks very easily. Great IPA to enjoy as the snow starts to fall."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Had this on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD. The beer poured a slightly cloudy honey-amber with a dense, thick, white head into a pint glass. The smell was of pumpkin pie - no joke - pumpkin pie. The taste was actually like drinking a slice of pumpkin pie, complete with the pumpkin and spice flavors - very unique and cool, I must admit. Good carbonation and lacing. I am not in any way a fan of fruited or otherwise spice-enhanced beer, but I must admit that this offering from ST was not bad at all."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12oz bottle poured into snifter. A: Hazy golden-straw colored ale with a nice fluffy white head with good retention. S: Aroma of typical saison esters and phenols. Also, aromas of anise, wormwood, nag champa, clove, and other undectable spices. T: The typical excellent stillwater saison flavors are there. However, the spicing is a bit too dominant. This brew definitly has a absinthe flavor. Interesting, but not particularly well balanced. M: The mouthfeel is perfect as usual. A nice strong carbonation supporting a rather full body. O: A very interesting beer which I will probably not buy again. Stillwater offers so many unique choices that are far better than this."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This is a good IPA. It is fairly malty so the hops don't stand out as much as they may in other IPAs. Not a terribly complex IPA but a nice beer. If you are looking for an IPA to take to the river or golf course (i.e. in a can) this is your best option--currently your only option. I think it is a lot better on draft at the source. This is my favorite Kettlehouse beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Thanks to Jim at Sherbrooke for the sample. Comes in a 650 ml brown bottle. Pours out a translucent almond colour, with a couple of fingers worth of creamy/spongy beige head that slowly settles to a thick cap. The aroma presents toasty and wafery malt with some raisin notes, not overly complex. Flavour still doesn't seem to jive after several sips. A one-two punch of nearly cloyingly sweet malt at first, a brief pause in the middle, and then a jumble of beefed up hops on the finish and long into the aftertase. Sweet, almost worty, malt up front in the flavour, with a bit of a nutty character, while the hops dry things out shortly after, turning things grainy and then spicy, followed by a herbal astringency. The elements are there, but the balance isn't, it's a flip-flop from one extreme to another. Fuller-bodied mouthfeel, creamy smooth and silky texture, with moderate carbonation. Would benefit with some adjustments to refine both the malt and hop content and find a more cohesive balance between the two. While Eisbock is still a fairly rare style on the shelves in general, and Canadian produced ones even moreso, this seems to fall short of the mark for the style in general."}

T: Not as much roast as in the nose, mostly chocolate and a hint of coffee. Not overly complex on the palate but it is a solid tasting brew. M: A little more carbonation than I would prefer (I would be interested to have this on cask). But it's got average body, a little on the lighter side maybe.

Carbonation streaming from the bottom. S: Woah, this beer is extremely reminiscent to their retired (and my personal favorite) Crack'd Wheat. I get tons of clove and tons of cinnamon and it just smells absolutely fantastically fresh and bold and full of wheaty goodness. T: Clove and cinnamon battle each other out as a light fruitiness parts their way. It finishes with a taste of wheat, then a very light spiciness remains on the palate. Just a tiny bit of bitterness to let you know you are drinking a beer. A lemon zest hop character is noticeable as well. M: Light-medium, refreshing, and surprisingly, not overcarbonated. Maybe even a touch creamy; smooth as all hell. All in all, this beer is an awesome release from New Glarus. I highly recommend picking this one up, because if there is one thing New Glarus does exceptionally well (besides their fruit beers) is their wheat beers. I just wish they would not have ceased production of Crack'd Wheat."}

It pours a nice black with a tan finger of head. The smell is mainly of smoked malts and coffee, with a bit of whiskey in the back. The taste is mainly whiskey and smoke. There are hints of both vanilla and roasted chocolate. This is a fairly smooth beer, but the alcohol is astringent on the palate. In spite of that it's still rather smooth and a extraordinarily nice drinking beer. Overall it is one of the better recommendations that I can make for any beer."}

These then quickly evolve into notes of astringency and black pepper. NOT enjoyable. M: Good body. Well balanced with the oak overtones actually making their way into the mouthfeel of this beer, which smooths out its character. Too bad this couldn't be said for the taste. D: When a beer tastes this bad, it's not possible to be very drinkable at all. I'll need to try this beer again. It may be possible that I got a bad bottle.

{"label": 1, "text": "I don't have a lot to say about this beer. The rye character just didn't come through for a beer that brags on the label to have 18% rye in the grain bill. Nice color and drinkable, but maybe I got an old bottle. It didn't seem to be super hoppy or have a distinct rye character. The bottle art is misleading. Not a bad beer, just not something I would buy again. The label also seems to have another marketing error. It states the sediment might be there in the bottle due to a \"truck-load of hops\". It has been my experience that hops settle out pretty well in brewing and it is just yeast sediment in a bottle. Kind of shook my faith in Bear Republic to see that statement."}

The strongest scent, to me, is coconut. Bourbon is also present. As a whole, the nose is very rich and deep. Nice. There is a considerable alcohol taste. But, honestly, what do you expect from a beer like this? Coconut is huge here as well, with some fresh pineapple, peaches and, in the background, bit of tart cherries even comes through. It's very spicy. There's a great complexity going on here. This brew blurs the line between beer and fine liquor, but is still surprisingly drinkable considering. I had one of these a while back, and in comparison I think this one was a bit more boozy. Maybe it's the age? Mouthfeel is medium thickness with low carbonation."}

This one is all malt, but it never becomes sweet to the point of becoming cloying, which is nice. It would be a very smooth beer, except for the underlying presence of the alcohol. Mouthfeel: Very thick and creamy, almost chewy. Very nice. Drinkability: It was enjoyable, but the alcohol was too noticeable in this one.

{"label": 2, "text": "Polished pumpkin with a lustrous luminescence when backlit with radiant morning sunshine. The incredibly creamy crown is more ecru than alabaster. It almost looks good enough to be called Belgianesque, something that rarely occurs with Belgian-style beer brewed in America. An attractive array of tattered lace graces the glass. The aroma is pretty close to classic for the style. I used those words because this Belgian pale ale uses American hops (Centennial and Cascade). Their citrusiness takes a backseat to what smells like an incredibly estery yeast strain, though that's fine with me. Warming brings out even more boldness. This is fantastic beer that reminds me of one of the all-time great ales in this corner of the country (or anywhere else for that matter). New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat is a kick-ass hefeweizen that uses American hops and does so in gobsmacking fashion. Zotten isn't quite that special, but it is a marvelous marriage of the Old World and the New World. The mouthfeel is more than fine and has picture perfect carbonation that adds sparkliness to a flavor profile that is already as zippy and zesty as all get out. That said, no one who knows better would mistake it for having been brewed in Belgium. Zotten is Belgian/Flemish for 'fools'. Anyone who loves Belgian-style beer that is insanely drinkable would be foolish not to seek this one out. I'm amazed at how many styles (from a multitude of countries) that Weyerbacher does well. Slam Dunkel and this beer are perfect examples. *reviewed on 10-25-2009"}
{"label": 1, "text": "I don't know, this is a very odd beer. Pours a very dark ruby red color, with no head at all. The smell is an overpowering malty sweetness with a distinct hop aroma that I can't place for the life of me. Taste is just odd, it's not at all displeasing, but this beer is so sweet, so over the top with malt sugars and malt roastiness. The hop bitterness is greatly subdued by the sugary sweetness of the heavey malt - definitely a red ale, no doubts there in the flavor, just BIG. I usually find big red's like this (Saint Rogue, Santa's Private, CascaZilla) to be more approachable and this beer is definitely something that requires thought before drinking a bomber of. I had never tried it before, so I didn't know what to expect and what I got was a big malty red super sweet, slightly bitter red. I'm kind of tempted to suggest that if the bitterness were more pronounced that this beer would be much more balanced and more enjoyable. I mean it's certainly not a bad beer, and if I were to see it on tap somewhere I might grab a pint, but I think this will not grace my fridge again any time soon, I just can't imagine being in the mood for this when I'm at home relaxing."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Presentation: Standard looking 500ml tall brown glass bottle. My bottle looks slightly different to that one shown in the BA Database; a dark orange V-shaped neck label has the words Malteser Weisse, whereas the main label has a more expanded description listing the brew as Malteser Weisse Naturtrb with the phrase Das Bier, Das Uns Zu Freunden Macht underneath the Coat of Arms and the word Bischofshof. The back label states that the Original 1649 is brewed in accordance with the Rheinheitsgebot. Listed at 5.15% in very small text with a Best Before Date of 14.04.05. Appearance: Murky turbid brown body that has a muddy look. The head is positively gargantuan on the pour and necessitates a slower than usual pour in an effort to pour the contents in one go, but I fail miserably. The off-white head is very creamy with a bubbly but relatively smooth surface that settles to a fine looking thick head which laces nicely. Average carbonation levels. Nose: Caramel, malts, biscuit and a light milk chocolate aroma. Some banana and cloves, but not much, only a decent hint. Taste: Very much in line with the nose here, starts with a nice Twix-like toffee coated biscuit finger with some milk chocolate flashes. As it middles the banana toffee and cloves break into the frame as does some yeast traits. Decent finish which is not big in strength, but does linger for a while. Nice carbonation lends a spritzy feel at times. Mouthfeel: Like a whipped up coffee made from warmed milk, this has a decent thick body that is nevertheless aerated to lend some lightness to the overall feel. Drinkability: A tasty enough dark Wheat that has some redeeming features but is a little one-dimensional in the longer term and just lacks that something to differentiate itself. Overall: I enjoyed this one but it isnt one that I would buy again to be honest."}

{"label": 2, "text": "A - Pours a pale hay-like golden hue with a lively effervensant fizz that forms a crop of refined head which quickly diminishes. Plenty of fine yeast granules floating about inside. Very nice looking brew S - Bready and yeasty. Subtle hint of hops and citrus zest T - Quite Interesting. Smooth and crisp maltiness up front that gives way to a nice bitterness in the finish. Perfectly balanced with a hop-tonic like quality that doesnt overpower. M - Great feel. Big and Bready enough to remind me of a hefeweisse, but with the flavor profile of a balanced Pale. D - Overall a wonderfully enjoyable beer and an extremely drinkable EPA. Well balanced but enough complexity to keep it interesting. I will certainly pick some of this up again."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic. Pours a crystal clear light golden hue with a one finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is decent with some lacing here and there. Smell is a powerful burst of flowers, honey, and spice. A lot more in the nose than I had expected. Taste is a light lemongrass flavor blended with some malt sweetness. Finish is quite bitter, much more dry than I had anticipated. Mouthfeel is very light with a good amount of carbonation. Good representation of the style. Drinkability is pretty good, bitter aftertaste takes away from it a bit though. Give it a try if you have the chance."}
{"label": 2, "text": "As the style suggests, this beer is a red/copper color. It is crystal clear and has a tan creamy head. The head, however, is small and quickly dissipates. There is lacing along the sides of the glass, which gives the beer an apetizing look when tipped/being drunk. When agitated the lacing thickens, and moves more towards the center of the glass. In my opinion, the beer would look much better if there were better head retention. To the nose this beer is also pleasing. The aroma is not quite as potent as I would like but, even though hard to smell, it smells good. I detect a slight lightly roasted/toasted smell in this beer, and don't really smell any aromas that I can attribute to hop charater. This beer is good. I really appreciate the flavor of this brew. It has a carmel taste with hints of lightly roasted/toasted flavors as well. It is sweet in the mouth, and in the after taste there is more of the light roasted/toasted flavor. Overall it is a good brew, however, there are better beers from the Great Lakes Brewing Co. The mouthfeel of this beer is pretty good as well. I believe that the medium body of this beer is appropriate to the style. It feels a bit heavier and thicker than water on the palate and has a dry finish. It is very easy to drink, and is much better warmer as opposed to colder. Not quite a session beer, but I could just chill with some buddies and drink this one all night long. This is a beer that I'll probably buy next winter when it hits the shelves again."}

Up front the taste is full of coffee and bitter chocolate with lots of sweetness from the oats in the middle more chocolate in the end. Not boozy at all. Well balance. Really nice mouthfeel, thick and creamy. I can't pick up on any alcohol at all in here, which makes its rather drinkable for its ABV. Good beer."}

D-Not an awful stab at a DIPA by any means, but this one is lacking in hop aroma and flavor for me. A DIPA should be bomb in terms of flavor and aroma and this one just doesn't live up to my expectation of the style."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Apperance - Clean and clear copper/amber color, carbonation is good Nose - Very smokey sweet sensation, almost a hickory kick Taste - Very dark, almost peated malt taste despite the color variable. Sweet malts are there, almost a dark liquorish bite. Earthy mushrooms and dark truffle tastes come through as well. Mouthfeel - Very smooth almost syrupy but in the best way possible, carbonation compliments well. Aftertaste - Smokyness lingers long, with the sweet dark fruits of plum and raisens. Overall - While this is not my favorite style of beer, it is the work of craftsman brewers. Both smoke and dopple bock beers are very difficult beers to brew, and this is a great combination of the two."}

Visible carbonation when held to light. Very attractive considering it's holiday nature. Might not be as appetizing as a regular year-long brew; looks like fizzy cranberry juice. S- Again with the cranberry juice; mouthwateringly tart and sweet nose, backed with light, classic ale malts. No discernible hops present. Delicious smelling! T- Tart, slightly sweet with more ale grains in the taste. The actual raspberry flavors are dimmed a bit, but come to life in the slightly sticky sweet aftetaste. Decent, but I was expecting more fruits in my mouth. That sounded really gay. My apologizes. M- Medium light body with a wonderful smoothness. Felt almost zero carbonation. D- This beer would become tiring quickly; the tartness would quickly lead to palate fatigue and would overpower the next beer. Best enjoyed as a one-beer treat with good friends and family at Christmas time."}

M - Good carbonation for an imperial stout. Medium body when it's cold from the fridge, as it warms the body turns heavy and slightly syrupy. D - The warmer it gets the heavier it gets. I drank the last glass over the course of about an hour to see how it warmed up. Those last few sips were good but thick. Overall I did really like this stout.

This does not mean balance. Just a lot of mild not so appealing notes. But as I say that, I also must admit that it goes down pretty well with a cold salad. Very easy to drink. Would I buy again? Only if very cheap. It was a gift, so I don't know the price."}

Aroma of figs, raisins, toasted barley and coffee. Strong coffee approach with an intense sweetness, with a slightly hoppy bitterness and somewhat dry finish. Quite warming from the alcohol. Carbonation is pretty low, feels chewy and rich. This one is definitely a sipper. Well crafted interpretation that is reasonably balanced but personally I think the coffee is overemphasized in the flavor profile, and could be improved if it were more subtle."}

Mouthfeel is a little watery but plenty carbonated. Its great. Like others have said...not overly complex but that doesnt make it a bad beer. It was thoroughly enjoyed....Very good!"}

Wet grass and orange blossom smells rose from the glass and faded into a faint alcohol scent with some tangerine-y sweetness in the malt. Mouthwatering. Hoppy orange and citrus tastes prevailed initially, lending a balanced taste that wasn't too bitter. Though it tasted less balanced as it warmed, it still made for a refreshing aperitif. Some late musty tastes. Mouthfeel was crisp and drying, but seemed thin for the appearance and smell. Overall, a very appetizing brew that didn't hit me over the head with hops like some DIPAs. I could definitely have some more."}

Since there is no comparison with this I give it an average smell. Lots of licorice up front mixed with definate root beer and molasses. Not bad smelling, just unusal for beer. Lots of unusual flavors for beer. Again licorice with root and birch beer. Molasses and I almost detect ginger. Dry and medium carbonation. As unique and unusual as it is, it is also hard to drink. Not impossible just not highly drinkable. All in all its OK. Try one for yourself."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Served in a Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. When we first tried this beer years ago, a buddy of mine made it seem that he was among the Untouchables as well...in that you couldn't bribe him enough to willingly drink this again. Let's see if my tastebuds have evolved since then. This stuff pours a clear copper-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, and some very mild and light orange zest. The taste brings the orange forward, mostly in terms of the peel, with the caramel and toffee coming in later. In the end, though, is a short but sharp stab of harsh bitterness. This is probably what turned my buddy and me off so long ago, and not much has changed (though my reaction now is decidedly less vitriolic). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry-ish finish. Overall, an okay brew, but not something I really wanna go for again."}

Smells of cherries and citrus tartness. There isn't much else there... maybe some malt notes, but it's all dominated by the tart fruit aroma. I love it. Sweet pucker, it tastes sharp, sour and mildly fruity. The cherries come through very well and the clean Cantillon sourness is outstanding. Great beer. It could be a little more drinkable, maybe if there were more carbonation it would lighten it up a bit, not sure, but half a glass was enough for me."}

It smells like ether, and floral aromatic hops. In fact it smells much more alcoholic then it tastes, the hop characteristics hide the 9.6% alcohol by volume. This is an interesting take on a barlywine style, because not only is this beer different than a classic barlywine, its an Ale, and well hopped and balanced as well. Its got a nice smooth mouthfeel but drinkability is a question. Actually, this beer is a punch of hops straight to the mouth, but I think this beer was made to be savored with some food pairing way beyond my cognitive capacity or palate. Well done Sierra, I have not disliked a single beer from them..."}

The Lager style is not my favorite but this is a darn good beer and for it's style it's better than most."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Notes compiled from tastings all OVER India. Let me tell you, if you travel to India, this very well may be the only beer you can find. I have a hard time rating this one because the results are dramatically inconsistent. I think that product handling is not a priority in India, even in the 4 and 5 star hotels. Anyway, on with the show. The pour is heady and light straw in color, very clear and very carbonated. The smell is very subdued but has a lemony citrus smell & then hops. The taste is good when you can get one that has been handled properly. The draft ones I had were surprisingly malty & smooth for what I would have called a pilsner. Other than that it was standard hot-country beer but I was pleasantly surprised by the malt note. Many of the bottled samples I tried tasted like wet cardboard but I'll chalk that up to improper care, not brewing. The mouthfeel is nothing to write home about, too thin and watery. Drinkability is this beer's strong suit, again only when you get one in good condition. The malt stands up to spicy food but the light character makes it a refreshing break on a hot afternoon. All in all, better than most beers from its latitude. But that's a bit like picking your prettiest sister to take to the prom. I'm amending this because I'm now having ANOTHER terrible one and overall I've just had TOO many bad examples and the reader (if there is one for my dribble) deserves to know what they're getting into. If you get one that's been handled badly? It tastes like vinegar. Wow. Just undrinkable. Really, really, retchingly horrible. Makes me want to do a shot of formaldehyde to cleanse my palate."}

Those red berries appear in the taste too (as do those toffee mentions), the malts are also there, but lack depth within the flavours. Some hop hints, but again nothing powerful and without nuts.

{"label": 1, "text": "750 ML swing-top bottle &gt; 16 oz. Stella glass Well, finally a beer from France...let's see if the rumors are true. This one pours out totally clear with fast bubbles in orange-hued pale amber color with a huge 3\"+ extremely dense and creamy cloudy-white head, very impressive looking with amazing retention, very, very slow. The crown is very creamy with the rest a bit more scattered, but it's pretty tight overall. The lacing is numerous and VERY sticky. Looks good. The lable on this bottle is a bit of a mystery and makes you wonder a few things, like what style is this?? looks very much like a Farmhouse style ale. The nose had some whiff's of cream o' corn style malt, semi-sour and earthy yeast that is pretty potent. soft fruits like starfruit and mellows come to mind with banana's and cloves. Freshly husked corn and wheat fields way down deep. This brew is very malt dominated with honey-soaked sour dough bread flavor's, that seems to leave too many residual sugars. This has a crisp and clean, light body and feel at first but mellows in time which makes the malt a bit cloying. The yeast is spicey and very earthy giving off a sour fruity edge. The hops are leafy and dry creating a very long bitter finish with a dirt effect. Adding to the bitterness is the heat, which stands out way to much tasting like grain alcohol. The flavor's have a hard time balancing eachother out. This one starts out very nice and just falls apart as it warms. This one made me wonder, I knew the French were not exactly known for their beer's and the price for a 750 ML bottle being $4.99 really makes you wonder....why so cheap?? i still think this is a good deal for what it is."}
{"label": 1, "text": "from notes 25Nov2006. Pours a pale gold, reminiscent of honey (ha,ha), with a very thin head that fades quickly to almost nothing. There's only scattered bits of lacing. Smell; lots of ginger, which is to be expected, but I'm also getting a little lemon. The honey is there, it's just a little hard to pick out with the ginger being so strong. Taste; the ginger isn't quite as strong as it was in the aroma, and I'm glad. I don't think i could drink this if it was. The honey ands a nice sweetness, and the lemon adds just enough sour to offset that. This isn't a beer that I would ever purposely buy, but it wasn't a drain pour either. Mouthfeel is definitely on the thin side, and the lack of carbonation just adds to that feeling. The drinkability is OK, but the ginger would make it hard to drink more than this one bottle."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Y'know I'd seen this beer on the shelves for years and being a Bay Area native, you'd think I'd have tried it by now, but no... So I grabbed a bomber at the store the other day and psyched myself up. The beer poured a slightly hazy amber with a minimal head that quickly disappeared. I was immediately hit with the aroma of floral hops from several feet away. When I lifted the glass to my nose, shazam! A massive wall of fresh floral and resiny hops assaulted my my olfactory senses, but I like to be violated so this was a good thing. But in all seriousness, the aroma was outstanding - ranking up there with greats like Russian River's Pliny the Younger and Pizza Port's Hop 15. The malt of this beer was more subdued that some other DIPAs I've had, such as Alesmith's Yulesmith. It was Slightly caramelly and added just enough sweetness to let the hops flow smoothly. The carbonation was fine and tight, not too effervescent. I might have liked just a touch more CO2 here, but whatever. This beer was dry and seemed highly attenuated, which helped make this beer very drinkable considering how heavy it was. Many DIPAs fall victim to a final gravity that's too high, leaving a lip smacking sweetness that isn't always good. This beer avoids this problem completely. I'll be buying and recommending this one time and again. This was a truly outstanding beer."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Killian's pours a beautiful amber color with a head consisting of small bubblies, doesnt lace to the glass too well though. Smells sweet of carmel and malt hints, not too strong of a nose to it. This brew tastes mostly of caramel malt. Finish is of leafy hops, and caries a lightly pleasent hop/caramel aftertaste. Its a medium bodied beer, decent mouthfeel... but it lacks the creaminess of a real irish red. A lot of people dis this beer because its a coors product. True, its not a real irish red, but never the less its still a nice looking, good tasting brew. A bit too sweet perhaps yes, but at alot of places its the only decent beer available. I find it to be a faithful fallback beer. I dont think that it should be looked down upon just for being in the Coors lineup. If you've tried Micheal shea's Irish Red and like it, then try this... I find it to be quite similar."}

{"label": 2, "text": "I figured Weyerbacher would probably do a pretty good job with this style of beer, and sure enough they make a very good RIS. Pours an impressive dark color, with decent foam retention and fairly good lacing. On the nose I get a lot of coffee and chocalate, with a touch of sweet vanilla. On the palate this is a very nice beer indeed. It is not particularly heavy or intense, but with nice soft, smooth, sweet chocolate/coffee flavors. Although sweet, there is just a hint of dryness on the mid palate, which makes this beer all the more drinkable. On the impressive finish, I even pick up a trace of cherry along with the chocolate and coffee. The beer is surprisingly drinkable, and I have to say I appreciate the fact the abv. is \"only\" 8%. With an abv. like that, I might even be able to have a second glass. A winner from Weyerbacher."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A- Holy head!!! Bottle says pour slowly and that is a must. The brew itself is a nice blend of orange, maroon and apricot with some turbidity. It's fairly evident the brew is carbonated by quickly rising bubbles up to the massive frothy white head. Chunks of the stuff are left once it actually settles. S- Fairly fruity, which I'm guessing is from the Guava. I also pick up a bit of funk/barnyard aroma of brett in here though I don't believe it's used in this version. There is a definite malt presence in here as well. T- One of the maltiest Saison's I've had but it works. The fruitiness of the Guava blends so well with caramel and toffee. Strangley I pick up some chocolate in the aftertaste. M- Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Smooth on the mouth even with the bubbles though. Very drinkable. Abv not felt at all. O- I liked this a lot, moreso then the Dupont Saison. Maltier than any other I've had in the style, and the Guava fruit works to perfection. Unique for the style I feel, especially with the malt backbone. I'm falling for CCB and their brews."}

I can't see through the glass, but it is blanketed by almost a half a finger of white densely-packed head. S: The wheat is strong in this one. It's (the wheat) characteristic tartness has been augmented, resulting in a crisply tart, acidic nose. T: The ale builds to a climax, only to tumble off quickly. The wheat is very tart initially, sharp and acidic. That acidity builds, especially as it sits in my mouth, until it just, well, drops off the face of the earth. The acidity is there one minute, gone the next. In its place, biscuity malts hang out but they don't have the same intensity that the wheat did. The only remnant of the sharp bite is a mild lingering tartness, pale in comparison to the original dosage. M: The mouthfeel is a study in contrasts. Upfront, the tartness is fresh and strong; later is skulks away. Hey, on the bright side, it weighs in under 4%! D: Like most Berliner weissbiers, Hottenroth is low in alcohol and long on tartness, at least for a spell."}

Sour undertones to the effervescent nature of this beer. It is very light and smooth on the tongue and in your mouth, and there is little to no aftertaste. It would be easy to consume multiple bottles of this beer, but I can think of many better ways to spend an afternoon..."}

{"label": 0, "text": "i don't know if my bottle came from a bad batch, but there's something horribly wrong going on here. the brew didn't look all that bad. it poured a golden/light copper colour with a minimal head. i can only equate the smell to something along these lines: it seemed like something died in the bottle. this wasn't the standard heineken skunky smell, but much worse. sadly, i pressed on. the initial taste was nothing impresseive. almost completely watery with maybe a hint of grain or citrus (perhaps?), but the aftertaste was an absolute killer. worse than the smell. there was some sort of metal/sulfur/rye/skunk thing going on here that you'd really have to taste to believe. it's quite hard to describe. i couldn't even finish the pint because of it. others have said this brew isn't that bad. i may have to reluctantly give this one another shot down the road in hopes that i was a victim of a bad bottle, but for now, i'd recommend staying away from this brew."}

The smell started with a yeasty, citrus explosion right after the initial pour. Pale malts, grapefruit and slight candy sugar make up the rest of the smell. The smell is certainly good, but a little one dimensional in the hop catagory. The taste starts off with pale malts and grapefruit, some herbal hops and alcohol spice show up with a touch of pine. The aftertaste is a bit medicinal. Another good IPA from Port. One was good, but I damn sure enjoyed it."}

It has a very robust floral aroma. The beer's taste is of dry wheat, as well as an additional grain that is quite distinct in flavor but I couldn't identify it. It certainly tastes good though! The beer has a high amount of carbonation and a light body. Overall, an enjoyable Belgian pale, but not my favorite example of the style."}

A big start, but a somewhat dampened finish.., Wish there was a little more at the end. M: Lots of carbonation, but it doesn't leave a big impression. Like seltzer water, you notice a lot of carbonation, then the general lack of anything once you have swallowed it. D: I prefer something with a little stronger flavor, but still a good beer over all. Another great way to introduce newbies to an unfamiliar style.."}
{"label": 2, "text": "33cl bottle into 1/2-pint glass. BBE 23/03/07, today 17/01/06. Forbidden Fruit pours cloudy -- live yeast in the bottle -- with a half-finger foamy tan head over a dark amber body. Aroma is strongly malty in the Belgian style with undertones of grape, toffee, honey, wine, and lots of spirits...I'm also picking up a little wintergreen, which is an interesting touch. The first taste is quite smooth and weaker than one would expect from the nose. Scotchiness and spirits dominate but there is a little roastiness and grape and some bubblegum. Well-blended, with the aftertaste subtle and perhaps unambitious. Fruitiness is subdued and gets swamped by the spirits and sugar. The texture is heavy and thick and mildly acidic, with carbonation weak. Overall, this is decent, perfectly passable as a Belgian ale, but I wouldn't call it great. I feel like the bottle isn't doing is justice, though, and that on tap it would achieve a much more complex character."}

Light bodied, smooth, wet with a dry kick for a finish. Very easy to drink. Overall, seems like a decent offering from Southern Tier. Being my first American porter, the difference in the taste and mouthfeel was very noticeable in comparison to other English porters I've had. I think I prefer Fuller's over this, but still a nice fall beer."}
{"label": 1, "text": "An old stand-by, if there's a beer that hooked me on the APA style, it was this one many years ago. Certainly as in most things related to first loves, perceptions can be inflated due in part to relative experience and naivete. It should be interesting to see how this classic holds-up to closer inspection. Appearance is light amber, showing light hints of caramel malt. The head is decent with moderate fluffiness that fades faster than I would like. Overall carbonation, however, holds quite well. The aroma is unimpressive for the style. Somewhat dominated by alcohol odors, but mild doses of caramel malt wisp around too. Surprisingly, the aroma hops are extremely mild and less than I expected from memory. Flavor has mild hop bitterness with tinges of pine. Malt helps to round-out the flavors, but a slight sourness on the finish detracts from the overall flavor profile. Bitterness masks this a little, but the off-flavor is certainly present. The mouthfeel is slightly above average. While it doesn't live up to expectations, this beer will always hold a special place with me and warrant the occasional purchase. It's decently balanced and a good transition to the wonderful world of American Pale Ales. Although I don't live there now, when I first started drinking this beer, I lived in Northern California. I have to wonder if freshness has a lot to do with the perceived drop-off in quality in this review."}

The coffee/espresso, roasted malt, and chocolate dominate however they are not alone. The bourbon and alcohol flavors are present along with more subtle vanilla and dark fruit flavors. Full bodied which leaves a fairly strong coffee taste in the mouth. I have not been able to drink beer for a week due to a surgery and Im glad I made this one my first."}

Taste: The taste was a great balance of bitter then smooth. The initial taste is the bitter, traditional, porter taste. That is followed by a slight hoppy finish, which balances together perfectly. Mouthfeel: It was very pleasant. It was not overpowering in any facet. A little bit tingly initially, but smooth on the finish. Drinkability: A perfect session beer if Porter's are your choice. This was a great beer. I hope I can get my hands on more of it. This would be a staple in my fridge if I could get it regularly."}

Taste: All the ingredients mix really well to give it an almost champagne like flavor thats sour, fruity, and fresh. First the woody aged flavor hits your tongue. Followed by the fruitness of the cherries and finished off with malted barley. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is good where all of the flavors equal out, but the fruit and woodiness stand out.

Some faint unripe fruit, very underdeveloped taste with underlying lightly roasted sweet malts and flowery hops. Transluscent flavors of some light cocoa and clove find their way in but in trace amounts. Null and void, boring and plain.

Malt fades to a roasted/hop finish. However, a strong, biting gin/alcoholic taste kicks in, and that's the aftertaste I'm left with. I'd probably put a 5 on the taste if not for this. 4/5 M: Creamy and thick, full in body and flavor. 5/5 D: I'd say very drinkable for the style if not for the alcoholic element, but I'd be happy with a half pint of this; I struggled getting through the bomber. 2/5 Overall impression: This comes so close! I imagine it's very hard to get all of these complex tastes in a stout like this without the alcohol level going way high, but this one sure does. Unfortunately, there's no mask for the alcoholic taste at the end. I love everything else about this one, and I love the hints of oat. I'll come back to this one again in hopes of a slight improvement. Still good where it stands, but came so close to being a perfect stout for me."}

It smells like toasted malts, and a little bit like sawdust, but in a good way. The taste kind of threw me for a loop though. On one hand it has this rich smokiness that I'd expect out of an ale, but it finishes smooth like a lager. There's not a lot of mouth feel, but the flavor is unique. It finishes with more of that smoke and a dash of charry hops. I can't tell what to think about this beer. Is it an ale? Is it a lager? Do I even like it? I'm not really sure, but it's definitely worth a try. I might not buy it for myself, but I wouldn't turn it away if someone offered it to me."}

Left a hint of coffee and maybe toffee taste in my mouth. Wow, this is a great beer. If I could only have one beer a day I could live on just one of these a day. I'm really impressed with the Rouge beers so far."}
{"label": 0, "text": "A deeper-than-pale yellow with a small white head that doesn't have much staying power. As you raise the glass, two apricots suddenly lodge in your nostrils. No malt or hop aromas can fight their way through the apricot attack. The flavor is less dominated by the apricot, and a bit of malt sweetness does make it through once it warms up a little. I could not detect any hop presence through the sourness of the fruit. Is this a drinkable beer? I suppose if one likes carbonated fruit-flavored beverages in the style of the Mexican Jarritos (sp?) brand, but then why are you drinking beer? If you want to enjoy a beer, this is far too one-dimensional to keep your interest after the first half of the bottle."}

The aroma is spicy...ginger, molasses, sassafras, with touches of vanilla. It definitely has the earth root characteristic in the aroma. Very interesting. The flavor is herbal and earthy with the ginger and molasses. I get the licorice and/or star of anise in the flavor along with sassafras again. It leaves my mouth dry after the finish, but has a sweet twang in the middle. An interesting brew to try once, definitely not one that I would have again. If you were looking for an alcohol infused A&W, this ain't it. Interesting, but tough to choke down. I sense a drain pour coming."}

I've done a NW amber tasting tonight and this one is perfectly average. No real flaws, but totally indistinct. Not sure exactly how strong this is, they only give the OG, which is pretty pointless w/o the FG! Still, it's 1.056, so if this finished at say 1.015, it's only 5.3%...not very big at all!

Carbonation is very brisk- you can really watch those floaties go up and down, up and down. The nose is nice- clove and bananna yeast esters. The flavor is about spot on- not quite as strong as in what I would call a real wit- smooth, slightly sweet wheat malt, notes of coriander and a bit of peppery spiciness. Mouthfeel is round and smooth, yet crisp. Not a bad little wit, though if they were toning things down for the American palate, I think the chunks might be a huge negative to the neophyte. There was good lacing (with more chunks sticking to the glass), as the brew went down."}
{"label": 2, "text": "The last McAuslan seasonal I tried was the positively epic barrel aged Russian Imperial Stout, so I was keen to pick this one up! It poured out a deep amber with red tint, the head is quick to disappear but stays sticky on the side of the glass. The smell is of cloves, nutmeg, gingerbread, pumpkin pie, orange and caramel malt. Mmmm. The taste is a similar profile but distributed differently. Caramel and ginger flavours are big up front, with clove and then more nutmeg and pumpkin leading to an orange and cinnamon finish with a little hop crispness. Very complex, subtle, not artificial-tasting and quite pleasant. The drinkability is surprisingly good, at only 5% and with so much diverse flavour you really feel like it's worth having another. My only real complaint with this beer is the mouthfeel! To be honest, for a spicy rich fall beer I would have liked a bit of a heavier feel with less carbonated zing. It is nicely balanced though, with citrus keeping things crisp and an overall softness on the palate."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: Pours a copper/orange...very clear. A finger of white foam dissipates quickly. S: Pine, resin, citrus. Hops. Lots of hops. Yep. It's an IPA. T: Citrus hops lead the way, with a nice blend of pine and resin into it as well. The malt is there, but very subtle. Still, the hops dominate but do not overwhelm. Solid balance, and almost no showing of the alcohol. M: Smooth and crisp, and finishes dry. D: I've always wondered when Sierra Nevada would do an IPA. Their Pale Ale has always been a standard, and I'd say this is now poised to join it. This is a well-crafted and tasty beer."}
{"label": 2, "text": "On tap for the Sierra Nevada 30th Anniversary Party at the brewery. This was the star of the show (among many other stars) in my opinion. Pours a bright and clear light amber color with a nice creamy white head, good lacing down the sides of the glass. Aromas are phenomenal. The nose is just full of fresh resiny hops and tons of fruits. Mostly orange, tangerine, apricots, fresh cut pine, and resin. Taste is just like the nose. Tons of complex hops flavors bounce around your mouth. Apricots, tangerines, oranges, and sugary grapefruit. Backdrop provides a slightly sweet creamy malts. Finish is crisp, tangy, slightly dry, and with hints of pine bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth, very full, creamy, and with lively carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. This is the best DIPA I have had in quite some time. Awesome stuff. Hoping I can get a growler fill in a few days. Side Note : PLEASE Sierra Nevada, bottle this beer! I know Hoptimum is the next bottled offering, and that is a nice beer, but man... I thought Hopsichord was quite a bit better."}

Pours a reddish-brown color with a moderate brown head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma was very sweet, a bit of caramel, and alcohol. The flavor was very sweet, like the aroma, but not too sweet. The maltiness is present in the flavor as well as the alcohol and a tiny bit of the vanilla. This was an interesting beer, nice mouthfeel and not too hard to drink."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured to a two finger, cream colored head that slowly dissipated. Color is black with ruby edges. Taste, right off the bat, is of roasted malts and coffee grains. The vanilla notes are also right up front. For a porter, this is a bit too sweet for my tastes. The body is also a little thin and there&#8217;s a slight tongue slickness/residue that&#8217;s left behind. Drinkable, but I wouldn&#8217;t go out searching for another. ~Jonathan Passow"}
{"label": 1, "text": "330ml bottle. It ours a nice brown with a foamy off-white head that sticks nicely then recedes with a lot of lacing. The nose is perfumey and fruity. It has the thick scent of flowers, dates, and raisins. There is a hint of spice and caramel as well. The flavor brings to mind apples, raisins, and prunes. It has a metallic character that is kind of off-putting and herbally/medicinal hops. It is an okay dark ale, perhaps a bit sweet."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Pours a glowing ruby red/chestnut color...quite intriguing. Carbonation is slow and steady within the clear liquid. Head is a thin layer of fine, tan beads, with a smidge of lacework sticking to the glass. Nose is potent, laced with alcohol and cinnamon-like aspects, with some malty sweetness and cherry notes. Body is a solid medium, and carbonation as it applies to the mouthfeel is low, allowing for a smooth passage over the tongue. Pleasantly sweet flavor abounds, with just a hint of the cherry noted on the label. I get more notes of sweetness from the honey, plus a fine melding of spices, dark fruit and alcohol warmth. A fine bier to warm-up with in the midst of the cold-weather season. Thnx to BierReise for the sample! Zum Wohl!! overall: 4 appearance: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4 780"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Whoa, if that ain't the brownest, darkest harvest ale I've ever come across. Seriously, looks like a brown ale or a porter. Further surprising me, that this is classified as an apa. . . nothing pale about this one. Aroma actually was some peat and cocao just as much as hop bitterness. A decent amount of hops here, as far as wet or fresh hops go, this one doesn't really have much of a green hoppy vibe going for it, but that could be substantially covered up by the generous amount of brown and/or chocolate malt, not to mention the toffee and caramel presence. Really walks the line between a black and brown ale that is on hop roids. Bits of peat feel, make it further convuluted as like a fresh hop scotch ale. For the a little bit of everything approach, it kinda works, far from a abject failure of a beer, its kind of a off the beaten path type of harvest ale. Worth checking out."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Thanks to donkeyrunner for this extra Poured a deep, deep brown with a small tannish head, decent carbonation. Nose is very forward with cocoa powder. Taste is cocoa upfront and light astringent taste as well. This brew is thinner bodied than I liked but still ok."}

I will not try this beer again but I love Sam Adams Boston Lager, Winter brew, Same Adams Ale, Summer brew, etc."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured into my favorite 285mL weiss glass. A: Wow, this beer looks fantastic. Even on a very tentative pour I got a few inches of thick, poofy foam that settled down to a good inch or so. The beer underneath is a cloudy deep yellow to shiny gold. Little bubbles continuously creep up from the bottom of the glass. By the bottom of the glass there's only a very thin head with moderate lacing to 2/3 of the way up the glass. S: I'm not getting a lot of smell from this one. But what I get is distinct citrus and floral. There's a little bit of grain back there for balance. But as I said, the smell isn't particularly powerful. It's pleasant and soothing, as opposed to overpowering. T: A hit of sweetness at first, but not sugary. More like biting into a lightly sweet fruit, maybe a not-quite-ripe orange. Lots of complexity. Grains -- wheat? Light spice. A neat bitterness toward the end and on the finish. Very clean, somewhat crisp. No booze in the taste. Fairly distinctive lingering orange zest flavor. This beer is fantastic. It's perfectly balanced, it's inviting, it's neither beery or boozey. I think just about anyone could drink this and enjoy it. M: Medium -- there's a big boost from how foamy this beer is. The carbonation is nice and moves the flavors around well. Notably for this 9% beer there's pretty much no astringent alcohol. Great! D: Dangerous. Crisp, highly drinkable. Cool on a hot day. I'm having to force myself to slow down, because I know otherwise this 9% is going to catch up and kick my butt!"}

Mild sweetness. Mouthfeel: Thin to medium bodied, with a carbonation bite. Drinkability: It&#8217;s not a bad pale lager, but not many of them are that good, though. Easy enough to drink, with some unique flavors. Buy Again? Only when I want an Indian beer in when eating out."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Ah, faxe. Had this a few years ago while in Denmark digging up dead Vikings... I feel the same way about it now as I did then. It's okay enough looking, golden with some head. Smell is practically non-existent. A bit of sweetness, but you have to sniff really, really hard. Taste is watery- in fact, it tastes like water with a shot of beer in it. Barely hoppy, barely tasty. Mouthfeel is watery and thin. I could certainly keep drinking this- yes, the litre- if it was kept cold, and it does have some interesting Danish memories attached, but I will not be going after this again any time soon. Still, a litre that doesn't taste like crap and is cheap- college kids, get this instead of Bud."}

Wow, it was really such an overwhelming beer that I really have a hard time describing it -- Imagine taking a handful of citrusy and resiny PNW hop pellets and shoving them in your mouth. I'm serious, this beer was like drinking hopped wort, without the benefit of fermentation to ease the ravaging of my tastebuds. Ruination seems tame next to this beer."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Served on tap in a snifter glass at Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon in North Olmsted, OH. A - This beer is black with a foamy light caramel color head. S - At first the nose was very light, however once I drank a bit the glass was able to help concentrate the smell which brought out the distinct smell of coffee with some subtle hints of grape. Overall very pleasing and exactly what you'd expect out of something called \"Breakfast Stout\" T - The taste is coffee all the way, dark, black coffee. There's just enough malt sweetness to offset the bitterness of the coffee, but overall the taste is dry and lets the coffee come though. M - Mouthfeel is heavy, but lighter than you'd expect for such a dark beer. This doesn't coat the tongue like some sweeter Imperial or oatmeal stouts, and isn't creamy like Guinness. It is almost porter like. This helps it go down like a cup of coffee. If it was heavier it would detract from the coffee/beer experience. D - This beer is very drinkable for a stout, but it's still a big, heavy beer. A couple of these would be very filing. The high alcohol content also would probably stop me from having more than one or two at a time. However, I definitely would want to drink more than my body would let me."}

{"label": 2, "text": "Small bottle shared with Klym, SundaySour, and Myself in a weekend taster. Bottle is dated 4 May 2010. Poured into a Lost Abbey Tulip. A: Looks like a saltwater solution of amber sunshine. Cloudy but no appearance of floaties. There's a very hefeweizen like orangeness to this beer, but the thin patching of lambic bubbles lets you know otherwise. Dense diamond like bubbles line the glass like delicious bling-bling, gives an almost frosted appearance to the brew. S: A golden sweet wheatiness that never travels into the realm of artificial sugars. Pickled capsules of orange flesh, floating with whole kumquats. A super soft coriander note that keeps the theme orange on orange. Clementines sneak a peak, but ultimately never really take a starring role. Mild yeast funk seasons this juicy brew. T: Puckering green kumquats, with the rinds giving into to the tart and sour flesh. Super clean taste that has that wow factor. The flavor certainly comes off a bit green with some sweet limes sneaking in, but it never goes bitter. The flavors are clean and juicy, it's nearly impossible to not lick your lips after each sip. Super acidic presence of tartness, but honestly not nearly so acidic in digestion. Rinds are candied in a watery light sugar, then salted for fresh consumption. These rinds are fresh and zesty, Wow complexity. Sweet shiny pastries come to mind. So deep and adventurous. No vinegar at all. M: Such a fancy evaporating mouth-feel. The salty sweet character of the flavor invites a strong response of salivation, while the mouth is smothered with clean juices. It's like having a geyser go off in your mouth, wetness in the mouth without ever a perception of flatness at all, but the aspects you'd expect to feel (given the fruity/citrus flavor) never seems to come. There's no hop/rind bitterness, and the acidity is soft spoken at most. O: My first cantillon, and it didn't disappoint. I've had a few other Gueuze, but nothing as clean or refined as this. There's a magician in this glass, giving impressions of fruity small citrus fruits but eliminating rind bitterness. Puckering freshness that takes the intensity of the fruits to 11. This is well over a year old, and it has the intensity of something off the vine. So clean, and so good. This is an improvement on nature, and I commend the brasserie for their efforts. I can't wait to see what else these magicians have in store for me! Great first offering, and I'm begging for an encore."}
{"label": 2, "text": "12oz bottle into a snifter. Big thanks to jefferz5000 for hooking me up with this one. The cap pries off with a slight hiss. Poured down the center of my glass, this brew appears a clear golden yellow color. About a finger of white head forms across the top and quickly recedes. The cap holds around the outside edge of the glass and leaves some small patches and spots of lace. The smell of this brew is pretty darn inviting. Lots of lactic sourness to this brew's nose coming across lemon-like mixed with a nice pairing of subtle musty oak. Some funk that is reminiscent of something faintly like stinky cheese and a bit of sulfur rounds out the rest of the aroma. The taste is lactic sourness that has a citrus element that is a bit lemony. Despite the initial sharp flavoring, this is surprisingly not acidic. Through the body is a light yogurt flavoring and a bit of mild funkiness. Some very tame oak indications are evident across the back which is a nice contrast. This is a medium to light bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Overall a very decent representation of the style. All and all this is easily approachable and easy drinking but I think it comes up just a little short in the feel. To me this was a little watery. In a way this brew reminds me of a watered down version of Ithaca's Brute. This was my first time enjoying a Freetail offering yet it carried with it a lot of familiar character. Nothing off putting about it at all, just needs a little work to really dial it in. Thanks Jeff!"}

Smell is nearly nonexistent. Tastes like corn, corn and more corn. Bitterness is very light, you can taste the alcohol. To its credit, the mouthfeel is smooth and there's no harshness to it, but probably because it's simply so light and watery. I drank this one slow - there are better alternatives available, no reason to ever pick this one, even if it has the \"man-sized can\" going for it."}

Nutty malt backbone and just a touch of sweetness lie underneath. Not real sure what flavor they were going for here but I am not a huge fan. M/D - Light to medium body with an oily residue left behind in the mouth. Well carbonated. Just not the best of beers but certainly not a bad beer."}

The first involves new or interesting brews and is not applicable to Strohs.The second applies to older brands and American mass brews, and it is to ask whether the beer in question tastes and feels like the first beer I sipped from a crockery mug while sitting on my mother's knee many, many years ago. Does it have\"beer flavor\" More tha any American beer I know Strohs gets high marks for\"beer flavor\" and I rate it highly."}

Colour wise it was a cloudy pale yellow with about a 1/4\" of white head. I was a little disappointed in the flavour - all of the usual elements of a good Hefe were there: banana, citrus and wheat but very muted. Not too gassy - a few tiny bubbles coming out of suspension. A very refreshing beer on a hot sunny day."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Chilled bottle into a glass. Re-review off a fresh 2010 bottle sent by Wisconsinality. Thanks, Kylie! A: Pours an clear burnt orange that glows against the light. The head is a long-lived finger of light beige head. It vanishes into a small collar with some lace in its wake. S: Toasted malt is pretty evident. Grain, bread, something grape-like and woodsy. It's nice and satisfying; it reminds me of sitting in a wooden cabin in Tahoe as the weather was starting to turn cold. T: Toasted grain and bread -- simple, but satisfying. Small caramel flavor. There's something fruity about this that reminds me of grape. Really interesting. And frankly, for the style, it's very tasty. It has a clean, crisp finish. M: Light-bodied. Low-medium carbonation. It works well for a beer that is this flavorful, but I think it could use more bubbles. D: I'd love to sit and drink a 1L stein of this.

Reminds me of tea in a weird way. Huh. Pretty solid, but nowhere near as intense and pleasing as the aroma. M: Fairly light, frothy, and lively. Nice. O: I'm not at all sure whether this beer was supposed to be sour or not, but since everything else I've had from this brewery has been I wasn't surprised. The sage definitely lent a welcome bit of strangeness to an already strange beer. Pretty solid stuff. Cheers!"}

Belgian yeast gives off clove phenols and citrus tones which blend with the coriander and other citrus spice additions. AND do I smell...YES! Chamomile! (Ben the brewer confirmed my suspicions that Chamomile was added) T: Weak wheat malt flavor is trumped by the strong coriander and chamomile flavors blending very nicely with the citrus spices and Belgian yeast character. All flavors are very discernable, prominent, but not dominant leaving a very well balanced beer. M: Medium mouth feel with slightly higher than normal carbonation, perfect for the style. O: A great beer to have as their flagship. Many breweries attempt the Belgian Wit style and come up short. This beer is everything it's supposed to be and very easy to drink. Cheers!"}

But once I poured it into my snifter all pleasant aroma was lost. It was kind of...bland once poured. Low hops for the style. Taste - Weak. Surprisingly weak for a barleywine. There was some maltiness, some dried fruits, but little hops for the style. Maybe a little caramel and chocolate malts, but it was faint if it was there. Mouthfeel - Far to thin for the style. A barleywine should be beefy and bold feeling. This was water and wimpy Drinkability - I won't be revisiting this one if that tells you anything. The best I can say is this is a gateway barleywine...an introduction to the style to a neophyte. There was no body and the taste just wasn't where it needed to be. This is just another example of a beer getting a good rating based on its brewer and not its merit. I'm so sick of brewers making \"craft\" beer of low quality. They are hurting the name of American beer just as much as the macros are. Stay away from this one. EDIT - After posting this I went and reviewed some others comments and I have to say...I think this beer is getting a high rating simply on its ability to get you drunk and not its flavor. Sure 10.2 is a respectable ABV, but when you have nothing to back that up where are we felt?"}

There's a junkyard full of stuff laying in the bottom of the bottle. The 2nd glass from this 750 ml container was expectedly a cloudy dull orange. Aroma - peppery yeast smell, ripe bananas, a hint of raisins. Fades quickly and the residual aroma isn't worth much. Taste - light malty sweetness and some fruity sweetness, too. Just a faint yeasty flavor. Finishes with a tiny bit of sourness or bitterness, it's hard to tell which. Some weak alcohol warming, well-hidden. A fragile triple. Some nutty, woody flavors at the bottom of the bottle add an interesting extra, but too little too late for serious consideration. Mouthfeel - fairly thin and watery, helps to keep the sweetness in check. Low carbonation does not distract from the delicate flavors. Not really the body of a triple I'm thinking, but it's exactly the right call for this beer. Drinkability - if I see this on tap, I'll have to try it, but otherwise will likely not seek it out."}

Smell is great, very rich, toffee, caramelized brown sugar, sherry, earthy, some floral, cherries and berries, very fruity and sugary, wood, very nice. Taste is great too, brown sugar and toffee sweetness up front, caramelized raisins, bread, toast, very fruity, touch of iron, figs, very earthy and woody, alcohol but well hidden, very rich and intense sweet finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth but goes down real smooth. A great scotch ale, Cigar City is putting out some killer beers. Thanks Russ!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "RE-REVIEW (original bottle was *INFECTED*) Pours an insane mountainous head, off white with a blanket of thick dense bubbles. A light brownish body with orange hues throughout. Lacing all over the glass. A very strong floral aroma. Pine needles dipped in sweet cream. Light peppery yeast scents. The hops impart mild aromas, but are not very strong or pronounced they blend in. Very bready with a dose of rye/caraway seed oil. The malty flavors come thru with a significant amount of pepper and clove from the yeast and rye. The hops are adding more of a drying and bitterness to the beer than any pine or citrus, but floral flavors do come through. The rye sits on the tounge upfront, not heavy though. Also the alcohol comes through way more than expected for a 6.7% brew. This beer is quite an intersting take on an IPA. For me a bit more hop aroma/flavor would put this beer into the 'A' category. The hops play a nice part in this beer as well as the malts. The yeast imparts some great qualities in this beer as well. Carbonation feels almost right maybe a touch high. Glad I got to try this one. This is a very interesting take on an IPA and tastes like no other IPA I've had. I can tell a lot of 'craft' went into this beer. A touch more pine and/or mild citrus from the hops would push this beer into an outstanding category. [89/100]"}
{"label": 0, "text": "One of the clearest non-light beers I have seen. Head doesn't really maintain itself. Smells like stale bread, maybe cardboard, a little astringent. Taste has a fake creamed corn adjunctyness to it. A bit medicinal and cardboard in the finish. Body is lacking. I am always willing to try cheap beers in hopes of finding another PBR or MHL but this certainly wasn't it. Worse than tasteless, this was bad."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I enjoyed this from a 1L swingtop into a tulip. The color is golden with extremely hazed appearance kind of like lemon juice with rocky cap of white and spray of lace all over with ultra fine bead. The smell is mild with lots of kumquat and bitter grass with a slight malt sweetness in the aroma and alcohol ester accenting. The feel is bitter with some slight malt accents that seem more dry and the alcohol presence is there with a drying finish, tangy with a slightly astringent aspect that gives a edge with mild earthy nutty undertones. The bigger hop taste is good with some bitter orange and mild grassy elements from the hops with s slight malt body and generally strong bitter flavor, the astringent flavor is kept in check but there is a grassy note that combines with the mild citrus in the taste to give a pleasant overall hop that is bitter yet outweighs any alcohol that might creep into the flavor as it warms. This has a taste that is slightly acidic, but the grassy tannic aspect stands out with an overall good taste and drinkability, but only a little better than average in the overall scheme of things, I enjoyed this bottle and found it to be pretty decent in terms of an American Imperial IPA."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Bomber from Hy-Vee served in a SA glass I was happy to try a new release from Madhouse but unsure because it's a pilsener. It turned out to be one of the better pilz I've had. A light copper brew with a bunch of white foam. My nose picked up the alcohol but it wasn't offensive and seemed to have a bit of fruit to it. The taste was good for the style, the honey was present but not making it overly sweet. It has a mild crispness. There's no metallic taste at all, I'm not disgusted, there's actually a good pilsener out there. Hurray!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Black with tan foam, delicate striated webs of lace decorate the glass. Dark brown edges in the light. Smell is slightly sweet and roasty, fairly nondescript. Malty, light chicory, mellow smoke and vegetal notes. Slightly lactic somehow. Fully malty flavor, light roast and milk chocolate flavors, a bare hint of chili spice that leaves me wanting more unfortunately. On it's own, it's pretty good. Full bodied, rich and smooth feel. Toffee, chocolate, vegetal tobacco and ancho sweetness. Pretty easygoing, and deceptively smooth considering the higher abv. Pretty drinkable and not too spicy, just enough of a hint to make things interesting I guess."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Poured amber golden color with a small head. Nice smell with a caramel malty taste. This is a very drinkable Marzen and was a plesant surprise to find at a number of restaurants this past September - November. Even though I like Great Lakes or Old Dominion better I will look for this bear again this September."}
{"label": 1, "text": "The chalkboard in the comedy club said 7.1% abv. Pours a licorice black with very faint dark brown hues. Light tn ring of foam around the edge of the beer. Just a little lacing. The nose is full of dry dark chocolate with a touch of cream. The taste is splotchy patches of cheap chocolate, cheaper than Hershey, with hints of of powdered creamer. Gte weird medicinal hints intermingling with these nice flavors. The palate felt dry, and powdery. The aoma is a little misleading."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Slightly cloudy deep gold with light tan head..reduces to collar in a Leffe chalice. Smells great..clovey, yeasty, some alcolhol and malt. Tastes fantastic..this has got a lot going on. Fruits...apple, pear... a medium yeasty- clove- vanilla flavor with some hops and malt coming through....nice semi dry finish. This is a great complex mixture of everything I love about Belgian ales! ....in all the right proportions..amazing flavor. Mouthfeel is medium. Pretty drinkable....although, my girlfriend keeps reaching for the bottle...I might have to be happy with a glass and a half for now. If you love Belgians...you have to have this ale. I'll be buying this one again....probably tomorrow."}
{"label": 1, "text": "One of the most clever names I've ever seen on a beer. It begged to be drank. Poured out golden brown with a full head. Retention wasn't any particular. Smelled of citrus tones and possibly cascade hops. Taste was surprisingly sweet. The sweet malts are shockingly present - and the bitter hops seem to be an after taste, but believe me, it is one bitter experience when it kicks in. Incredibly dry and hoppy at the end. I was shocked to find that it was 9% ABV because it does very well to mask the high alcohol content. Overall, a good beer. Great for hop-lovers, I imagine, but odd that it was borderline overly sweet in the beginning. If nothing else, try it for the name's sake."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Bottled on 24-10-2002, making this one a bit over 3 years old! The Orval Trappist Ale pours into my big Orval chalice a nice amber brown hue with streaks of orange as well. A tight bubbly white head lingers atop the brew in a fine fashion. Looks lovely in the glass. Aromas are intensely unqiue and perplexing at the same time. Sweet caramel spice smacks up against a musty, yeasty earthiness. A touch of leather mingles with some cotton candy/bubblegum aromas. Fruity with a touch of sour cherry, cinnamon and brown sugar. Maybe even a bit woody but definetly enchanting with each inhalation evoking new scents in my mind. First sip brings a crisp, dry spicy caramel infused with a plethora of flavors that dash across the palate on the trip down the throat. Hints of leather and wood along with some musty sour funkiness that brings images of a cobweb filled brewery to my mind. Light fruit notes collide with brown sugar bubblegum. Spice cake. Lots of earthy yeast notes throughout. Quite the complex beer here. Finishes dry and crisp. Eccentric and ultimately a wonderful experience. Mouthfeel features a burst of champagne-esque carbonation that streaks across the mouth with each sip. A mellow medium body allows for easy drinking but maybe the bubbles could be toned down a tad. Drinkability is really quite wonderful as it goes down smooth and each sip brings a new realm of taste sensations. I would not mind seeing this in 750ml bottles! Purchased this pre-cellared for me at Liquor Stop in Highland, IN...didn't even look at the date when I bought it. I will be on the lookout for a fresh bottle to try in the near future. Another testament to the wonders of the Trappist breweries of Belgium. This will go down as one of my new favorites."}
{"label": 2, "text": "A: Very pale yellow with a large and bubbly white head. Pretty cloudy. Decent retention and lacing. S: Lemongrass, fresh hay, a bit of spice and tartness. Just a tiny bit of funk T: Slight fruitiness, lemon and tart apple taste with a good amount of spice and yeast. Again, a touch of funkiness. Finishes dry and slightly tart. M: A lot fuller body than I expected. It has very active and bubbly carbonation, yet its pretty creamy and thick. Odd, but very good feel. O: Very rustic and old country/old world like. I think they nailed what they were going after in this one. Doesn't have the best drinkability but worth trying out."}

{"label": 1, "text": "Bought at March du Bois (boul. des Forges, T-R), 6/11/03, stored cool dark, 2600 miles in my trunk. The head is medium-sized, slightly cream-colored, coarse and noisy. The beer is a straight, clear amber. Nose is schpoonque and peanuts. There's a tart, citrus zing in the front and a tangy middle. There's some maltiness in there, but not much. When cold, the finish is metallic and a little astringent. As it warms, there's some ok bitterness and nuttiness. Overall, this is a pretty boring attempt at an amber lager. Unibroue should stick to Belgians."}
{"label": 2, "text": "2010 bottling. This has been a long time coming. My store got a delivery of this and Cuvee des Champions last week. The delivery was a whopping 2 bottles of each. Pours a pale tangerine, a little sallow, with a 2 cm eggshell head. This smells much less tart or funky than I expected. Maybe that will change over years. Mostly oak, apricot, and salty air. It's very restrained. And, sour kick in the throat thank you very much! I don't know if I would pick out apricots if I didn't know they were there. It's a little fruity, but I taste much more oak and acidity. I would easily believe that this was a gueze and the fruity aspect was a yeast byproduct. There is also a seltzer water nuance that's kind of distracting. But it's still a Cantillon through and through, and it's delicious. Excellent tingle, medium body, and just dry enough. As much as I liked this, I can't justify spending the extra $10 to $12 over Gueze, Kriek, or Iris. It's really not better than them, and IMO, Iris is still the best one out there."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Part of a sample case bought from Costco. This brew is yellow and cloudy in appearance. Poured a small non sustaining head. Nose is good, of bananas and cloves. Taste is of cloves with a slight sour lemon finish. Mouthfeel is fully charged with a good amount of carbonation but is a tad bit too watery. Overall this is a fairly drinkable brew, definitely worth a try."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. A- Pours a golden, semi-hazy yellow. Produces a nice three fingers width of white, fluffy head. Great retention. S- A few swirls reveal a nice scent of subtle, sweet honey and various spices. Also getting a wheat aroma that provides the base for the scent. T- Fantastic! Upfront cloves and spices play off each other to create a solid taste. As the beer progresses, the wheat and honey complexions become more pronounced and give the beer a sweet, but refined finish. M- Light to medium bodied. Tons of carbonation, almost too much. The mouthfeel was perfect, except for the fact that there was so much carbonation that on the initial taste for each sip all you received was the feeling of millions of carbonated bubbles bursting. While it was short lived, it hindered the initial ability to taste the flavor. D- These beer is hilariously drinkable. 9% abv is a joke as it is virtually undetectable in this beer. Just a wonderfully made beer. Great taste, highly drinkable, not much more you can ask for. This is one that will always be in my house."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Bottle provided by hudsonphotog. Pours dark brown with an off-white head. The aroma is basically non-existent, possibly some roasted or caramel malt. As it warmed you got some maple syrup aroma, but it was always very faint. The flavor is also not very strong, with some roastyness and nuttyness. The mouthfeel is fairly watery and the carbonation is low. I have liked the other beers from Troegs and maybe this was a bad bottle, but this one is a miss for me."}
{"label": 1, "text": "picked up a single 12 oz. bottle to check this brew out and see if i should buy more. chilled to about 45 degrees and poured into my snifter. jet black standard imperial stout pour with very little head. nothing much going on here. smell is big blend of roasted malt, mostly just charred plum, slightly overdone breakfast toast, smoke from a smonker. taste is huge roast character up front. the roasted element here punches you in the face, roast chestnuts finishing up smoky and dry. big bold flavor profile from a big roast malt character. mouthfeel is super chewy which is nice, but not enough carbonation and the beer has a syrup character too it. not a bad stout but couldnt see myself wanting more than one slowly sipped glass. big, dry, roasty, smoky stout."}

{"label": 1, "text": "This was unusual in color. It was a murky, yellow with brown undertones. It had a cool, thick light yellow foam that faded quickly. The aroma was lemon, coriander and pepper...in that order. There was also a perfume smell that I wasn't crazy about. Typical wheat characteristics...slightly phenolic and a little banana aroma. The taste was much milder than the aroma. It had all the same notes...just not the intensity. It was medium bodied, and it had a nice, creamy mouthfeel. I felt it was really drinkable because all of the characteristics were mild...nothing was overbearing. Pretty good."}
{"label": 1, "text": "Presentation: Very cool swing-top bottle. Most of the label is in German and therefore foreign to me however it does say bottled on 25.11. (whatever that means). Served chilled in a stange glass. Appearance: Pours a hazy copper color with lots of suspended particles in the body. a huge head in the stange has decent retention and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell: The smell is simple yeasty caramel malts. Taste: The taste is dry with both fruit and vegetable attributes. It has a caramel malt base with some smokey flavors and grain. There are hints of apples and carrots and finally some grassy hops. The aftertaste and the burp a vegetal. Mouthfeel: really quite dry and lingers on endlessly. Drinkability: Maybe it isn't fresh or maybe that is the way this beer is built. It is enjoyable for one but not really my cup-o-tea so one is enough for me. Hope this is helpful. Cheers!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "I bought a few of these at the Alesmith brewery several months ago and thought it was time to brake one out. Pours a black color. Big initial tan head that slowly faded but lasted to the end. Nice lacing on the way down. Aroma is light coffee, roasted malt, and a tad bit of alcohol. Flavor is COFFEE and CHOCOLATE. Nice bitterness balance. Slight alcohol warming. Very smooth, full bodied beer. Best beer Ive ever had."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Reviewed from notes This one pours a golden yellow with a huge two fingers of sticky head. The aroma is a blast of grassy hops, with a backbone of bready and sweet malt. A hint of metallic aroma. The taste is very well balanced, but that doesn't necessarily mean good. Pretty light on the hops, but what is there is a grassy/earthy mix. Some bready maltiness and a hint of must. The body is normal for the style but drinkability just isn't there...it is too watery for the style."}
{"label": 2, "text": "pours to a somewhat golden brown amber with an enormous head that will leave lace till the end of the day. the aroma is very welcoming with nice yeast odors and some very good malts cooming about. there is also a definite hint of alcohol. the body is very rich and smooth. it is very good to drink as is slides right down. a great flavored beer with everything in balance. a very good malty sweetness dominates with a good addition of bitterness, and it was pleasant to find just a small tinge of alcohol."}

M: Full-body with light carbonation. Coated mouth very well and had a slight dry finish. D: Exceptional; the best Irish Red I have had. I highly recommend this beer to people, even if this isn't your style."}

{"label": 1, "text": "When I saw the \"Super Bock\" label, I thought I might get a good deal. They say it's a strong beer tough it's only 5.6% abv. The fact that the beer was made in Portugal made me feel uncomfortable. Would I get one of those tasteless beers? Well, it's a bock after all so I should be safe right? Turns out not. The light brown bottle seems to have let in too much light. I got that skunky smell as soon as I opened the bottle. (both bottles I bought were like that). This should not happen with brown bottles. The head retention is quite decent. There is a taste of hops and grain. I definetly got that metallic aftertaste some described. The fact that it was unfortunately skunked has definetly altered the taste.This is definetly NOT a bock tough the name says it is. This beer might not be too bad around the pool on hot summer days but it's a bit expensive since it's an imported beer. This reminds me of a Corona in a brownish bottle."}
{"label": 0, "text": "My first beer from Great Divide creates little enthusiasm. I'm sure the rest of their line is better. This porter pours a deep, cola brown. A thin head of light brown foam quickly fizzles out. Leaving a faint ring and absolutely no lace. The aroma is predominantly coffee with some cocoa and brown sugar. There's an underlying earthiness to it that just does not belong here. Flavor is bittersweet cocoa, stale coffee, and nondescript hop bitterness. The earthy aroma translates into what simply tastes like dirt, actual dirt. There's some maltyness to it, but overall there is very little balance displayed. Body is thin, bordering on watery. Carbonation is big bubbles that makes it hard to swallow. Overall, a rather unpleasant porter. There is not one thing that I like about it."}
